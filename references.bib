	abstract = {Due to their multimodal capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have found numerous impactful applications in real-world scenarios. However, recent studies have revealed that VLMs are vulnerable to image-based adversarial attacks, particularly targeted adversarial images that manipulate the model to generate harmful content specified by the adversary. Current attack methods rely on predefined target labels to create targeted adversarial attacks, which limits their scalability and applicability for large-scale robustness evaluations. In this paper, we propose AnyAttack, a self-supervised framework that generates targeted adversarial images for VLMs without label supervision, allowing any image to serve as a target for the attack. Our framework employs the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm, with the adversarial noise generator pre-trained on the large-scale LAION-400M dataset. This large-scale pre-training endows our method with powerful transferability across a wide range of VLMs. Extensive experiments on five mainstream open-source VLMs (CLIP, BLIP, BLIP2, InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) across three multimodal tasks (image-text retrieval, multimodal classification, and image captioning) demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack. Additionally, we successfully transfer AnyAttack to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini, Claude Sonnet, Microsoft Copilot and OpenAI GPT. These results reveal an unprecedented risk to VLMs, highlighting the need for effective countermeasures.},

	abstract = {Recently in robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a transformative approach, enabling robots to execute complex tasks by integrating visual and linguistic inputs within an end-to-end learning framework. While VLA models offer significant capabilities, they also introduce new attack surfaces, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. With these vulnerabilities largely unexplored, this paper systematically quantifies the robustness of VLA-based robotic systems. Recognizing the unique demands of robotic execution, our attack objectives target the inherent spatial and functional characteristics of robotic systems. In particular, we introduce two untargeted attack objectives that leverage spatial foundations to destabilize robotic actions, and a targeted attack objective that manipulates the robotic trajectory. Additionally, we design an adversarial patch generation approach that places a small, colorful patch within the camera's view, effectively executing the attack in both digital and physical environments. Our evaluation reveals a marked degradation in task success rates, with up to a 100{\textbackslash}\% reduction across a suite of simulated robotic tasks, highlighting critical security gaps in current VLA architectures. By unveiling these vulnerabilities and proposing actionable evaluation metrics, we advance both the understanding and enhancement of safety for VLA-based robotic systems, underscoring the necessity for continuously developing robust defense strategies prior to physical-world deployments.},

Prior works have shown that it is possible to print adversarial patches on clothes to evade DNN-based person detectors. However, these adversarial examples could have catastrophic drops in the attack success rate when the viewing angle (i.e., the camera’s angle towards the object) changes. To perform a multi-angle attack, we propose Adversarial Texture (AdvTexture). AdvTexture can cover clothes with arbitrary shapes so that people wearing such clothes can hide from person detectors from different viewing angles. We propose a generative method, named Toroidal-Cropping-based Expandable Generative Attack (TC-EGA), to craft AdvTexture with repetitive structures.

Extensive research has demonstrated that incorporating sophisticated perturbations into input images can lead to a catastrophic degradation in DNNs’ performance. This perplexing phenomenon not only exists in the digital space but also in the physical world. Consequently, it becomes imperative to evaluate the security of DNNs-based systems to ensure their safe deployment in real-world scenarios, particularly in security-sensitive applications. To facilitate a profound understanding of this topic, this paper presents a comprehensive overview of physical adversarial attacks. First, we distill four general steps for launching physical adversarial attacks. Building upon this foundation, we uncover the pervasive role of artifacts carrying adversarial perturbations in the physical world. These artifacts influence each step. To denote them, we introduce a new term: adversarial medium. Then, we take the first step to systematically evaluate the performance of physical adversarial attacks, taking the adversarial medium as a first attempt. Our proposed evaluation metric, hiPAA, comprises six perspectives: Effectiveness, Stealthiness, Robustness, Practicability, Aesthetics, and Economics.

Also, while we use the Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) algorithm to generate physical adversaries that fool tracking models when imaged under diverse conditions, we compare the impacts of different scene variables to find practical attack setups with high resulting adversarial strength and convergence speed.

	abstract = {Adversarial camouflage is a widely used physical attack against vehicle detectors for its superiority in multi-view attack performance. One promising approach involves using differentiable neural renderers to facilitate adversarial camouflage optimization through gradient back-propagation. However, existing methods often struggle to capture environmental characteristics during the rendering process or produce adversarial textures that can precisely map to the target vehicle, resulting in suboptimal attack performance. Moreover, these approaches neglect diverse weather conditions, reducing the efficacy of generated camouflage across varying weather scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we propose a robust and accurate camouflage generation method, namely RAUCA. The core of RAUCA is a novel neural rendering component, Neural Renderer Plus (NRP), which can accurately project vehicle textures and render images with environmental characteristics such as lighting and weather. In addition, we integrate a multi-weather dataset for camouflage generation, leveraging the NRP to enhance the attack robustness. Experimental results on six popular object detectors show that RAUCA consistently outperforms existing methods in both simulation and real-world settings.},

	abstract = {Recent work has documented the susceptibility of deep learning systems to adversarial examples, but most such attacks directly manipulate the digital input to a classifier. Although a smaller line of work considers physical adversarial attacks, in all cases these involve manipulating the object of interest, e.g., putting a physical sticker on an object to misclassify it, or manufacturing an object specifically intended to be misclassified. In this work, we consider an alternative question: is it possible to fool deep classifiers, over all perceived objects of a certain type, by physically manipulating the camera itself? We show that by placing a carefully crafted and mainly-translucent sticker over the lens of a camera, one can create universal perturbations of the observed images that are inconspicuous, yet misclassify target objects as a different (targeted) class. To accomplish this, we propose an iterative procedure for both updating the attack perturbation (to make it adversarial for a given classifier), and the threat model itself (to ensure it is physically realizable). For example, we show that we can achieve physically-realizable attacks that fool ImageNet classifiers in a targeted fashion 49.6\% of the time. This presents a new class of physically-realizable threat models to consider in the context of adversarially robust machine learning. Our demo video can be viewed at: https://youtu.be/wUVmL33Fx54},

Yet, widespread adoption of VLAs for robotics has been challenging as 1) existing VLAs are largely closed and inaccessible to the public, and 2) prior work fails to explore methods for efficiently fine-tuning VLAs for new tasks, a key component for adoption. Addressing these challenges, we introduce OpenVLA, a 7B-parameter open-source VLA trained on a diverse collection of 970k real-world robot demonstrations. OpenVLA builds on a Llama 2 language model combined with a visual encoder that fuses pretrained features from DINOv2 and SigLIP. As a product of the added data diversity and new model components, OpenVLA demonstrates strong results for generalist manipulation, outperforming closed models such as RT-2-X (55B) by 16.5\% in absolute task success rate across 29 tasks and multiple robot embodiments, with 7x fewer parameters. We further show that we can effectively fine-tune OpenVLA for new settings, with especially strong generalization results in multi-task environments involving multiple objects and strong language grounding abilities, and outperform expressive from-scratch imitation learning methods such as Diffusion Policy by 20.4\%. We also explore compute efficiency; as a separate contribution, we show that OpenVLA can be fine-tuned on consumer GPUs via modern low-rank adaptation methods and served efficiently via quantization without a hit to downstream success rate.

	abstract = {This paper introduces Diffusion Policy, a new way of generating robot behavior by representing a robot’s visuomotor policy as a conditional denoising diffusion process. We benchmark Diffusion Policy across 12 different tasks from 4 different robot manipulation benchmarks and find that it consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art robot learning methods with an average improvement of 46.9\%. Diffusion Policy learns the gradient of the action-distribution score function and iteratively optimizes with respect to this gradient field during inference via a series of stochastic Langevin dynamics steps. We find that the diffusion formulation yields powerful advantages when used for robot policies, including gracefully handling multimodal action distributions, being suitable for high-dimensional action spaces, and exhibiting impressive training stability. To fully unlock the potential of diffusion models for visuomotor policy learning on physical robots, this paper presents a set of key technical contributions including the incorporation of receding horizon control, visual conditioning, and the time-series diffusion transformer. We hope this work will help motivate a new generation of policy learning techniques that are able to leverage the powerful generative modeling capabilities of diffusion models. Code, data, and training details will be publicly available.},

In contrast, human beings are endowed with world models that depict imagination about future scenarios to plan actions accordingly. To this end, we propose 3D-VLA by introducing a new family of embodied foundation models that seamlessly link 3D perception, reasoning, and action through a generative world model. Specifically, 3D-VLA is built on top of a 3D-based large language model (LLM), and a set of interaction tokens is introduced to engage with the embodied environment. Furthermore, to inject generation abilities into the model, we train a series of embodied diffusion models and align them into the LLM for predicting the goal images and point clouds. To train our 3D-VLA, we curate a large-scale 3D embodied instruction dataset by extracting vast 3D-related information from existing robotics datasets. Our experiments on held-in datasets demonstrate that 3D-VLA significantly improves the reasoning, multimodal generation, and planning capabilities in embodied environments, showcasing its potential in real-world applications.},

	abstract = {Foundation Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in multi-modal representation learning, comprehension, and reasoning. By injecting action components into the VLMs, Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) can be naturally formed and also show promising performance. Existing work has demonstrated the effectiveness and generalization of VLAs in multiple scenarios and tasks. Nevertheless, the transfer from VLMs to VLAs is not trivial since existing VLAs differ in their backbones, action-prediction formulations, data distributions, and training recipes. This leads to a missing piece for a systematic understanding of the design choices of VLAs. In this work, we disclose the key factors that significantly influence the performance of VLA and focus on answering three essential design choices: which backbone to select, how to formulate the VLA architectures, and when to add cross-embodiment data. The obtained results convince us firmly to explain why we need VLA and develop a new family of VLAs, RoboVLMs, which require very few manual designs and achieve a new state-of-the-art performance in three simulation tasks and real-world experiments. Through our extensive experiments, which include over 8 VLM backbones, 4 policy architectures, and over 600 distinct designed experiments, we provide a detailed guidebook for the future design of VLAs. In addition to the study, the highly flexible RoboVLMs framework, which supports easy integrations of new VLMs and free combinations of various design choices, is made public to facilitate future research. We open-source all details, including codes, models, datasets, and toolkits, along with detailed training and evaluation recipes at: robovlms.github.io.},

In this second iteration, we extend the original image-text training objective with several prior, independently developed techniques into a unified recipe -- this includes captioning-based pretraining, self-supervised losses (self-distillation, masked prediction) and online data curation. With these changes, SigLIP 2 models outperform their SigLIP counterparts at all model scales in core capabilities, including zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and transfer performance when extracting visual representations for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Furthermore, the new training recipe leads to significant improvements on localization and dense prediction tasks. We also train variants which support multiple resolutions and preserve the input's native aspect ratio. Finally, we train on a more diverse data-mixture that includes de-biasing techniques, leading to much better multilingual understanding and improved fairness. To allow users to trade off inference cost with performance, we release model checkpoints at four sizes: ViT-B (86M), L (303M), So400m (400M), and g (1B).},

These models could greatly simplify the use of images in any system by producing all-purpose visual features, i.e., features that work across image distributions and tasks without finetuning. This work shows that existing pretraining methods, especially self-supervised methods, can produce such features if trained on enough curated data from diverse sources. We revisit existing approaches and combine different techniques to scale our pretraining in terms of data and model size. Most of the technical contributions aim at accelerating and stabilizing the training at scale. In terms of data, we propose an automatic pipeline to build a dedicated, diverse, and curated image dataset instead of uncurated data, as typically done in the self-supervised literature. In terms of models, we train a ViT model (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) with 1B parameters and distill it into a series of smaller models that surpass the best available all-purpose features, OpenCLIP (Ilharco et al., 2021) on most of the benchmarks at image and pixel levels.},

	abstract = {Multi-modal hashing learns binary hash codes with extremely low storage cost and high retrieval speed. It can support efficient multimodal retrieval well. However, most existing methods still suffer from three important problems: 1) Limited semantic representation capability with shallow learning. 2) Mandatory feature-level multimodal fusion ignores heterogeneous multi-modal semantic gaps. 3) Direct coarse pairwise semantic preserving cannot effectively capture the fine-grained semantic correlations. For solving these problems, in this paper, we propose a Bit-aware Semantic Transformer Hashing (BSTH) framework to excavate bit-wise semantic concepts and simultaneously align the heterogeneous modalities for multi-modal hash learning on the concept-level. Specifically, the bitwise implicit semantic concepts are learned with the transformer in a self-attention manner, which can achieve implicit semantic alignment on the fine-grained concept-level and reduce the heterogeneous modality gaps. Then, the concept-level multi-modal fusion is performed to enhance the semantic representation capability of each implicit concept and the fused concept representations are further encoded to the corresponding hash bits via bit-wise hash functions. Further, to supervise the bit-aware transformer module, a label prototype learning module is developed to learn prototype embeddings for all categories that capture the explicit semantic correlations on the category-level by considering the co-occurrence priors. Experiments on three widely tested multi-modal retrieval datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method from various aspects.},

	abstract = {The Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation system, designed to recommend potential future visits of users based on their checkin sequences, faces the challenge of data scarcity. This challenge primarily stems from the data sparsity issue, namely users interact with only a small number of POIs. Most existing studies attempt to solve this problem by focusing on POI check-in sequences, without considering the substantial multi-modal content information (e.g. textual and image data) commonly associated with POIs. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal content-aware framework for POI recommendation (MMPOI). Our approach addresses the issue of data sparsity by incorporating multi-modal content information about POIs from a new perspective. Specifically, MMPOI leverages pre-trained models for inter-modal conversion and employs a unified pre-trained model to extract modal-specific features from each modality, effectively bridging the semantic gap between different modalities. We propose to build a Multi-Modal Trajectory Flow Graph (MTFG) which combines the multi-modal semantic structure with check-in sequences. Moreover, we design an adaptive multi-task Transformer that models users’ multi-modal movement patterns and integrates them for the next POI recommendation tasks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MMPOI outperforms state-of-the-art POI recommendation methods. To facilitate reproducibility, we have released both the code and the multi-modal POI recommendation datasets we collect1.},

	abstract = {Multi-modal hashing supports efficient multimedia retrieval well. However, existing methods still suffer from two problems: (1) Fixed multi-modal fusion. They collaborate the multi-modal features with fixed weights for hash learning, which cannot adaptively capture the variations of online streaming multimedia contents. (2) Binary optimization challenge. To generate binary hash codes, existing methods adopt either two-step relaxed optimization that causes significant quantization errors or direct discrete optimization that consumes considerable computation and storage cost. To address these problems, we first propose a Supervised Multi-modal Hashing with Online Query-adaption method. A self-weighted fusion strategy is designed to adaptively preserve the multi-modal features into hash codes by exploiting their complementarity. Besides, the hash codes are efficiently learned with the supervision of pair-wise semantic labels to enhance their discriminative capability while avoiding the challenging symmetric similarity matrix factorization. Further, we propose an efficient Unsupervised Multi-modal Hashing with Online Query-adaption method with an adaptive multi-modal quantization strategy. The hash codes are directly learned without the reliance on the specific objective formulations. Finally, in both methods, we design a parameter-free online hashing module to adaptively capture query variations at the online retrieval stage. Experiments validate the superiority of our proposed methods.},

	abstract = {Unsupervised hashing has the desirable advantages of label independence, high storage, and retrieval efficiency, which is suitable for scalable image retrieval. Most existing methods focus on enhancing the image hashing model training process at the offline stage. However, little attention has been paid to the query content analysis by them at the online retrieval stage. They still suffer from important query semantic shortages, and thus limit the online retrieval performance, which is the ultimate objective of the image retrieval system. In this paper, we propose an Online Query Expansion Hashing (OQEH) for efficient image retrieval, by adaptively enhancing the discriminative capability of query hash codes in an expansion manner at the online retrieval stage. Specifically, we first design a self-expansion network to learn semantically invariant feature representations from images and their visual augmentations. Then, we conduct neighborhoodexpansion to search similar samples for each image from a query expansion set with the semantically invariant features and design a Transformer architecture to adaptively transfer the semantics of neighbor samples to their corresponding images. With the support of semantically invariant features, query expansion set, and adaptive semantic transfer, the representation capability of query hash codes can be enhanced at the online retrieval stage. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed OQEH method achieves superior retrieval accuracy and comparable retrieval efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Particularly, on MS COCO dataset, OQEH can obtain about 6\% performance improvement compared with the state-of-theart results.

They are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially for the form of subtle perturbations to the inputs. Although many adversarial attack methods have been proposed to handle the robustness of hashing retrieval models, they still suffer from two problems: (1) Most of them are based on the white-box settings, which is usually unrealistic in practical application. (2) Iterative optimization for the generation of adversarial examples in them results in heavy computation. To address these problems, we propose an Efficient Query-based Black-Box Attack (EQB

              A) against deep cross-modal hashing retrieval, which can efficiently generate adversarial examples for the black-box attack. Specifically, by sending a few query requests to the attacked retrieval system, the cross-modal retrieval model stealing is performed based on the neighbor relationship between the retrieved results and the query, thus obtaining the knockoffs to substitute the attacked system. A multi-modal knockoffs-driven adversarial generation is proposed to achieve efficient adversarial example generation. While the entire network training converges, EQB

	abstract = {Deep cross-modal hashing has promoted the field of multi-modal retrieval due to its excellent efficiency and storage, but its vulnerability to backdoor attacks is rarely studied. Notably, current deep cross-modal hashing methods inevitably require large-scale training data, resulting in poisoned samples with imperceptible triggers that can easily be camouflaged into the training data to bury backdoors in the victim model. Nevertheless, existing backdoor attacks focus on the uni-modal vision domain, while the multi-modal gap and hash quantization weaken their attack performance. In addressing the aforementioned challenges, we undertake an invisible black-box backdoor attack against deep cross-modal hashing retrieval in this article. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in this research field. Specifically, we develop a flexible trigger generator to generate the attacker’s specified triggers, which learns the sample semantics of the non-poisoned modality to bridge the cross-modal attack gap. Then, we devise an input-aware injection network, which embeds the generated triggers into benign samples in the form of sample-specific stealth and realizes cross-modal semantic interaction between triggers and poisoned samples. Owing to the knowledge-agnostic of victim models, we enable any cross-modal hashing knockoff to facilitate the black-box backdoor attack and alleviate the attack weakening of hash quantization. Moreover, we propose a confusing perturbation and mask strategy to induce the high-performance victim models to focus on imperceptible triggers in poisoned samples. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method has a state-of-the-art attack performance against deep cross-modal hashing retrieval. Besides, we investigate the influences of transferable attacks, few-shot poisoning, multi-modal poisoning, perceptibility, and potential defenses on backdoor attacks.

In this paper, we extend the scope of this effectiveness by showing that visual robot manipulation can significantly benefit from large-scale video generative pre-training. We introduce GR-1, a straightforward GPT-style model designed for multi-task language-conditioned visual robot manipulation. GR-1 takes as inputs a language instruction, a sequence of observation images, and a sequence of robot states. It predicts robot actions as well as future images in an end-to-end manner. Thanks to a flexible design, GR-1 can be seamlessly finetuned on robot data after pre-trained on a large-scale video dataset. We perform extensive experiments on the challenging CALVIN benchmark and a real robot. On CALVIN benchmark, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods and improves the success rate from 88.9\% to 94.9\%. In the setting of zero-shot unseen scene generalization, GR-1 improves the success rate from 53.3\% to 85.4\%. In real robot experiments, GR-1 also outperforms baseline methods and shows strong potentials in generalization to unseen scenes and objects. We provide inaugural evidence that a unified GPT-style transformer, augmented with large-scale video generative pre-training, exhibits remarkable generalization to multi-task visual robot manipulation.

Leveraging methods such as masked autoencoding and contrastive learning, these representations exhibit strong transfer to policy learning for visuomotor control. But, robot learning encompasses a diverse set of problems beyond control including grasp affordance prediction, language-conditioned imitation learning, and intent scoring for human-robot collaboration, amongst others. First, we demonstrate that existing representations yield inconsistent results across these tasks: masked autoencoding approaches pick up on low-level spatial features at the cost of high-level semantics, while contrastive learning approaches capture the opposite. We then introduce Voltron, a framework for language-driven representation learning from human videos and associated captions. Voltron trades off language-conditioned visual reconstruction to learn low-level visual patterns, and visually-grounded language generation to encode high-level semantics. We also construct a new evaluation suite spanning five distinct robot learning problems \${\textbackslash}unicode\{x2013\}\$ a unified platform for holistically evaluating visual representations for robotics. Through comprehensive, controlled experiments across all five problems, we find that Voltron's language-driven representations outperform the prior state-of-the-art, especially on targeted problems requiring higher-level features.},

	abstract = {Imitation Learning (IL) is a sample efficient paradigm for robot learning using expert demonstrations. However, policies learned through IL suffer from state distribution shift at test time, due to compounding errors in action prediction which lead to previously unseen states. Choosing an action representation for the policy that minimizes this distribution shift is critical in imitation learning. Prior work propose using temporal action abstractions to reduce compounding errors, but they often sacrifice policy dexterity or require domain-specific knowledge. To address these trade-offs, we introduce HYDRA, a method that leverages a hybrid action space with two levels of action abstractions: sparse high-level waypoints and dense low-level actions. HYDRA dynamically switches between action abstractions at test time to enable both coarse and fine-grained control of a robot. In addition, HYDRA employs action relabeling to increase the consistency of actions in the dataset, further reducing distribution shift. HYDRA outperforms prior imitation learning methods by 30-40\% on seven challenging simulation and real world environments, involving long-horizon tasks in the real world like making coffee and toasting bread.

In this paper, we present the Robotics Diffusion Transformer (RDT), a pioneering diffusion foundation model for bimanual manipulation. RDT builds on diffusion models to effectively represent multi-modality, with innovative designs of a scalable Transformer to deal with the heterogeneity of multi-modal inputs and to capture the nonlinearity and high frequency of robotic data. To address data scarcity, we further introduce a Physically Interpretable Unified Action Space, which can unify the action representations of various robots while preserving the physical meanings of original actions, facilitating learning transferrable physical knowledge. With these designs, we managed to pre-train RDT on the largest collection of multi-robot datasets to date and scaled it up to 1.2B parameters, which is the largest diffusion-based foundation model for robotic manipulation. We finally fine-tuned RDT on a self-created multi-task bimanual dataset with over 6K+ episodes to refine its manipulation capabilities. Experiments on real robots demonstrate that RDT significantly outperforms existing methods. It exhibits zero-shot generalization to unseen objects and scenes, understands and follows language instructions, learns new skills with just 1{\textasciitilde}5 demonstrations, and effectively handles complex, dexterous tasks.

	abstract = {This work introduces the Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MDT), a novel diffusion policy framework, that excels at learning versatile behavior from multimodal goal specifications with few language annotations. MDT leverages a diffusion-based multimodal transformer backbone and two self-supervised auxiliary objectives to master long-horizon manipulation tasks based on multimodal goals. The vast majority of imitation learning methods only learn from individual goal modalities, e.g. either language or goal images. However, existing large-scale imitation learning datasets are only partially labeled with language annotations, which prohibits current methods from learning language conditioned behavior from these datasets. MDT addresses this challenge by introducing a latent goal-conditioned state representation that is simultaneously trained on multimodal goal instructions. This state representation aligns image and language based goal embeddings and encodes sufficient information to predict future states. The representation is trained via two self-supervised auxiliary objectives, enhancing the performance of the presented transformer backbone. MDT shows exceptional performance on 164 tasks provided by the challenging CALVIN and LIBERO benchmarks, including a LIBERO version that contains less than \$2{\textbackslash}\%\$ language annotations. Furthermore, MDT establishes a new record on the CALVIN manipulation challenge, demonstrating an absolute performance improvement of \$15{\textbackslash}\%\$ over prior state-of-the-art methods that require large-scale pretraining and contain \$10{\textbackslash}times\$ more learnable parameters. MDT shows its ability to solve long-horizon manipulation from sparsely annotated data in both simulated and real-world environments.

Although Hete-CD has been developed for about three decades, and various related methods have been developed and applied successfully in practice, a systematic and comprehensive review of the current achievements regarding Hete-CD remains lacking. Therefore, in this article, we first present an overview of Hete-CD in terms of the related literature. Second, the major techniques of Hete-CD are reviewed in terms of publicly available datasets, the taxonomy of major techniques, results, performance, and quantitative evaluation. Then, some classical methods are selected for comparison and discussion. Finally, based on the discussion and literature review, challenges, opportunities, and future directions for Hete-CD are concluded. The review aims to provide a “one-stop-shop” understanding of the problems with the categories of existing approaches, open opportunities and challenges, and potential future directions for Hete-CD.},

	abstract = {The robotics community has consistently aimed to achieve generalizable robot manipulation with flexible natural language instructions. One primary challenge is that obtaining robot trajectories fully annotated with both actions and texts is time-consuming and labor-intensive. However, partially-annotated data, such as human activity videos without action labels and robot trajectories without text labels, are much easier to collect. Can we leverage these data to enhance the generalization capabilities of robots? In this paper, we propose GR-MG, a novel method which supports conditioning on a text instruction and a goal image. During training, GR-MG samples goal images from trajectories and conditions on both the text and the goal image or solely on the image when text is not available. During inference, where only the text is provided, GR-MG generates the goal image via a diffusion-based image-editing model and conditions on both the text and the generated image. This approach enables GR-MG to leverage large amounts of partially-annotated data while still using languages to flexibly specify tasks. To generate accurate goal images, we propose a novel progress-guided goal image generation model which injects task progress information into the generation process. In simulation experiments, GR-MG improves the average number of tasks completed in a row of 5 from 3.35 to 4.04. In real-robot experiments, GR-MG is able to perform 58 different tasks and improves the success rate from 68.7{\textbackslash}\% to 78.1{\textbackslash}\% and 44.4{\textbackslash}\% to 60.6{\textbackslash}\% in simple and generalization settings, respectively. It also outperforms comparing baseline methods in few-shot learning of novel skills. Video demos, code, and checkpoints are available on the project page: https://gr-mg.github.io/.},

Despite significant advancements achieved through deep learning-based methods, executing high-precision change detection in spatio-temporally complex remote sensing scenarios still presents a substantial challenge. The recent emergence of foundation models, with their powerful universality and generalization capabilities, offers potential solutions. However, bridging the gap of data and tasks remains a significant obstacle. In this paper, we introduce Time Travelling Pixels (TTP), a novel approach that integrates the latent knowledge of the SAM foundation model into change detection.

Different from other dense prediction tasks, a meaningful consideration for change detection is the interaction between bi-temporal features. With this motivation, in this article we propose a novel general change detection architecture, MetaChanger, which includes a series of alternative interaction layers in the feature extractor. To verify the effectiveness of MetaChanger, we propose two derived models, ChangerAD and ChangerEx with simple interaction strategies: aggregation-distribution (AD) and feature “exchange.” AD is abstracted from some complex interaction methods, and feature “exchange” is a completely parameter and computation-free operation by exchanging bi-temporal features. In addition, for better alignment of bi-temporal features, we propose a flow-based dual-alignment fusion (FDAF) module which allows interactive alignment and feature fusion. Crucially, we observe Changer series models achieve competitive performance on different scale change detection datasets. Further, our proposed ChangerAD and ChangerEx could serve as a starting baseline for future MetaChanger design. Code and weights are made available at https://github.com/likyoo/open-cd.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a unified diffusion framework (dubbed UniDiffuser) to fit all distributions relevant to a set of multi-modal data in one model. Our key insight is – learning diffusion models for marginal, conditional, and joint distributions can be unified as predicting the noise in the perturbed data, where the perturbation levels (i.e. timesteps) can be different for different modalities. Inspired by the unified view, UniDiffuser learns all distributions simultaneously with a minimal modification to the original diffusion model – perturbs data in all modalities instead of a single modality, inputs individual timesteps in different modalities, and predicts the noise of all modalities instead of a single modality. UniDiffuser is parameterized by a transformer for diffusion models to handle input types of different modalities. Implemented on large-scale paired image-text data, UniDiffuser is able to perform image, text, text-to-image, image-to-text, and image-text pair generation by setting proper timesteps without additional overhead. In particular, UniDiffuser is able to produce perceptually realistic samples in all tasks and its quantitative results (e.g., the FID and CLIP score) are not only superior to existing general-purpose models but also comparable to the bespoken models (e.g., Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2) in representative tasks (e.g., text-to-image generation).},

	abstract = {Robot behavior policies trained via imitation learning are prone to failure under conditions that deviate from their training data. Thus, algorithms that monitor learned policies at test time and provide early warnings of failure are necessary to facilitate scalable deployment. We propose Sentinel, a runtime monitoring framework that splits the detection of failures into two complementary categories: 1) Erratic failures, which we detect using statistical measures of temporal action consistency, and 2) task progression failures, where we use Vision Language Models (VLMs) to detect when the policy confidently and consistently takes actions that do not solve the task. Our approach has two key strengths. First, because learned policies exhibit diverse failure modes, combining complementary detectors leads to significantly higher accuracy at failure detection. Second, using a statistical temporal action consistency measure ensures that we quickly detect when multimodal, generative policies exhibit erratic behavior at negligible computational cost. In contrast, we only use VLMs to detect failure modes that are less time-sensitive. We demonstrate our approach in the context of diffusion policies trained on robotic mobile manipulation domains in both simulation and the real world. By unifying temporal consistency detection and VLM runtime monitoring, Sentinel detects 18\% more failures than using either of the two detectors alone and significantly outperforms baselines, thus highlighting the importance of assigning specialized detectors to complementary categories of failure.

	abstract = {High-resolution remote sensing (RS) image change detection (CD) focuses on ground surface changes. It has wide applications, including territorial spatial planning, urban region detection, and military operations. However, class imbalance and pseudochanges are caused by the unchanged areas far outnumbering the changed areas and lighting changes. To address these problems, we propose spatial–temporal attention with a difference enhancement-based network (STADE-CDNet). In STADE-CDNet, a CD difference enhancement module (CDDM) is proposed to extract important features from the difference map to detect changed regions. This module enhances the network with differential feature attributes through the training layer, improving the network’s learning ability and reducing the imbalance problem. A temporal memory module (TMM) is designed to extract temporal and spatial information. Inspired by the self-attention mechanism of the transformer, we propose a transformer and TMM (TTMM). Four encoding layers are designed to detect the semantic information from high to low levels of the multitemporal image pairs. The fusion and parallelism of multivariate data are achieved through collaborative modeling of deep learning and CD, compensating for the need for excessive human intervention in traditional algorithms. We evaluate our approach in two different datasets [LEVIR building CD (LEVIR-CD) and deeply supervised image fusion network for change detection (DSIFN-CD)]. Promising quantitative and qualitative results show that the STADE-CDNet can improve accuracy. In particular, the proposed CDDM significantly reduces false positive detection, with F1 scores at least 1.97\% and 2.1\% higher than other methods in the case of the LEVIR-CD and DSIFN-CD datasets, respectively.

Despite the growing body of research, existing reviews rarely focus specifically on the unique safety and security challenges of embodied AI systems. Most prior work either addresses general AI vulnerabilities or focuses on isolated aspects, lacking a dedicated and unified framework tailored to embodied AI. This survey fills this critical gap by: (1) categorizing vulnerabilities specific to embodied AI into exogenous (e.g., physical attacks, cybersecurity threats) and endogenous (e.g., sensor failures, software flaws) origins; (2) systematically analyzing adversarial attack paradigms unique to embodied AI, with a focus on their impact on perception, decision-making, and embodied interaction; (3) investigating attack vectors targeting large vision-language models (LVLMs) and large language models (LLMs) within embodied systems, such as jailbreak attacks and instruction misinterpretation; (4) evaluating robustness challenges in algorithms for embodied perception, decision-making, and task planning; and (5) proposing targeted strategies to enhance the safety and reliability of embodied AI systems.

Existing cross-modal hashing methods primarily focus on centralized training scenarios, where fixed-scale and fixed-category multi-modal data is collected beforehand. However, these methods often face challenges associated with the potential risk of privacy breaches and high data communication costs during data transmission in real-world multimedia retrieval tasks. To tackle these challenges, in this article, we propose an efficient

In PEPFCH, we integrate local and global prototypes in order to effectively capture the distinctive traits of individual clients, while also harnessing the collective intelligence of the entire federated learning system. Moreover, to ensure the security of prototype information and prevent its disclosure during the aggregation process, we use a prototype encryption transmission mechanism to encrypt the prototype information before transmission, making it challenging for attackers to gain access to sensitive data. Additionally, to facilitate personalized federated learning and alleviate the issue of parametric catastrophic forgetting, we establish the image and text hyper-networks for each client and adopt a hyper-network extension strategy to selectively preserve and update previously acquired knowledge when acquiring new concepts or categories. Comprehensive experiments highlight the efficiency and superiority of our proposed method. To enhance research and accessibility, we have publicly released our source codes at:

	abstract = {Most cross-modal retrieval methods assume the multi-modal training data is complete and has a one-to-one correspondence. However, in the real world, multi-modal data generally suffers from missing modality information due to the uncertainty of data collection and storage processes, which limits the practical application of existing cross-modal retrieval methods. Although some solutions have been proposed to generate the missing modality data using a single pseudo sample, this may lead to incomplete semantic restoration and sub-optimal retrieval results due to the limited semantic information it provides. To address this challenge, this article proposes an Incomplete Cross-Modal Retrieval with Deep Correlation Transfer (ICMR-DCT) method that can robustly model incomplete multi-modal data and dynamically capture the adjacency semantic correlation for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we construct intra-modal graph attention-based auto-encoder to learn modality-invariant representations by performing semantic reconstruction through intra-modality adjacency correlation mining. Then, we design dual cross-modal alignment constraints to project multi-modal representations into a common semantic space, thus bridging the heterogeneous modality gap and enhancing the discriminability of the common representation. We further introduce semantic preservation to enhance adjacency semantic information and achieve cross-modal semantic correlation. Moreover, we propose a nearest-neighbor weighting integration strategy with cross-modal correlation transfer to generate the missing modality data according to inter-modality mapping relations and adjacency correlations between each sample and its neighbors, which improves the robustness of our method against incomplete multi-modal training data. Extensive experiments on three widely tested benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method in cross-modal retrieval tasks under both complete and incomplete retrieval scenarios.

	abstract = {Deep hashing has great potential in large-scale visual similarity search due to its preferable efficiency in storage and computation. Technically, deep hashing for visual similarity search inherits the powerful representation capability of deep neural networks, and it encodes visual features into compact binary codes by preserving representative semantic visual features. Works in this field mainly focus on building the relationship between the visual and objective hash spaces, while they seldom study the triadic cross-domain semantic knowledge transfer among visual, semantic, and hashing spaces, leading to a serious semantic ignorance problem during space transformation. In this article, we propose a novel deep tripartite semantically interactive hashing framework, dubbed Semantically Cycle-consistent Hashing Networks (SCHNs), for discriminative hash code learning. Particularly, we construct a flexible semantic space and a transitive latent space, in conjunction with the visual space, to jointly deduce the privileged discriminative hash space. Specifically, a new semantic space is conceived to strengthen the flexibility and completeness of categories in the semantic feature inference phase. At the same time, a transitive latent space is formulated to explore and uncover the shared semantic interactivity embedded in visual and semantic features. Moreover, to further ensure semantic consistency across multiple spaces, we propose to build a cyclic adversarial learning module to preserve and keep their semantic concurrence during space transformation. Notably, our SCHN, for the first time, establishes the cyclic principle of deep semantic-preserving hashing by adaptive semantic parsing across different spaces in a single-modal visual similarity search. In addition, the entire learning framework is jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments performed on diverse large-scale datasets evidence the superiority of our method against other state-of-the-art deep hashing algorithms.

	abstract = {By transferring knowledge from large, diverse, task-agnostic datasets, modern machine learning models can solve specific downstream tasks either zero-shot or with small task-specific datasets to a high level of performance. While this capability has been demonstrated in other fields such as computer vision, natural language processing or speech recognition, it remains to be shown in robotics, where the generalization capabilities of the models are particularly critical due to the difficulty of collecting real-world robotic data. We argue that one of the keys to the success of such general robotic models lies with open-ended task-agnostic training, combined with high-capacity architectures that can absorb all of the diverse, robotic data. In this paper, we present a model class, dubbed Robotics Transformer, that exhibits promising scalable model properties. We verify our conclusions in a study of different model classes and their ability to generalize as a function of the data size, model size, and data diversity based on a large-scale data collection on real robots performing real-world tasks.

	abstract = {Conventional machine learning algorithms suffer the problem that the model trained on existing data fails to generalize well to the data sampled from other distributions. To tackle this issue, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) transfers the knowledge learned from a well-labeled source domain to a different but related target domain where labeled data is unavailable. The majority of existing UDA methods assume that data from the source domain and the target domain are available and complete during training. Thus, the divergence between the two domains can be formulated and minimized. In this paper, we consider a more practical yet challenging UDA setting where either the source domain data or the target domain data are unknown. Conventional UDA methods would fail this setting since the domain divergence is agnostic due to the absence of the source data or the target data. Technically, we investigate UDA from a novel view—adversarial attack—and tackle the divergence-agnostic adaptive learning problem in a uniﬁed framework. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst report the motivation of our approach by investigating the inherent relationship between UDA and adversarial attacks. Then we elaborately design adversarial examples to attack the training model and harness these adversarial examples. We argue that the generalization ability of the model would be signiﬁcantly improved if it can defend against our attack, so as to improve the performance on the target domain. Theoretically, we analyze the generalization bound for our method based on domain adaptation theories. Extensive experimental results on multiple UDA benchmarks under conventional, source-absent and target-absent UDA settings verify that our method is able to achieve a favorable performance compared with previous ones. Notably, this work extends the scope of both domain adaptation and adversarial attack, and expected to inspire more ideas in the community.},

	abstract = {Multi-modal hashing fuses multi-modal features at both offline training and online query stage for compact binary hash learning. It has aroused extensive attention in research filed of efficient large-scale multimedia retrieval. However, existing methods adopt batch-based learning scheme or unsupervised learning paradigm. They cannot efficiently handle the very common online streaming multi-modal data (for batch-learning methods), or learn the hash codes suffering from limited discriminative capability and less flexibility for varied streaming data (for existing online multi-modal hashing methods). In this paper, we develop a supervised Flexible Online Multi-modal Hashing (FOMH) method to adaptively fuse heterogeneous modalities and flexibly learn the discriminative hash code for the newly coming data, even if part of the modalities is missing. Specifically, instead of adopting the fixed weights, the modalities weights in FOMH are automatically learned with the proposed flexible multi-modal binary projection to timely capture the variations of streaming samples. Further, we design an efficient asymmetric online supervised hashing strategy to enhance the discriminative capability of the hash codes, while avoiding the challenging symmetric semantic matrix decomposition and storage cost. Moreover, to support fast hash updating and avoid the propagation of binary quantization errors in online learning process, we propose to directly update the hash codes with an efficient discrete online optimization. Experiments on several public multimedia retrieval datasets validate the superiority of the proposed method from various aspects.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in robotics have focused on developing generalist policies capable of performing multiple tasks. Typically, these policies utilize pre-trained vision encoders to capture crucial information from current observations. However, previous vision encoders, which trained on two-image contrastive learning or single-image reconstruction, can not perfectly capture the sequential information essential for embodied tasks. Recently, video diffusion models (VDMs) have demonstrated the capability to accurately predict future image sequences, exhibiting a good understanding of physical dynamics. Motivated by the strong visual prediction capabilities of VDMs, we hypothesize that they inherently possess visual representations that reflect the evolution of the physical world, which we term predictive visual representations. Building on this hypothesis, we propose the Video Prediction Policy (VPP), a generalist robotic policy conditioned on the predictive visual representations from VDMs. To further enhance these representations, we incorporate diverse human or robotic manipulation datasets, employing unified video-generation training objectives. VPP consistently outperforms existing methods across two simulated and two real-world benchmarks. Notably, it achieves a 28.1{\textbackslash}\% relative improvement in the Calvin ABC-D benchmark compared to the previous state-of-the-art and delivers a 28.8{\textbackslash}\% increase in success rates for complex real-world dexterous manipulation tasks.},

However, current VLA models face significant challenges: they are slow during inference and require extensive pre-training on large amounts of robotic data, making real-world deployment difficult. In this paper, we introduce a new family of compact vision-language-action models, called TinyVLA, which offers two key advantages over existing VLA models: (1) faster inference speeds, and (2) improved data efficiency, eliminating the need for pre-training stage. Our framework incorporates two essential components to build TinyVLA: (1) initializing the policy backbone with robust, high-speed multimodal models, and (2) integrating a diffusion policy decoder during fine-tuning to enable precise robot actions. We conducted extensive evaluations of TinyVLA in both simulation and on real robots, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art VLA model, OpenVLA, in terms of speed and data efficiency, while delivering comparable or superior performance. Additionally, TinyVLA exhibits strong generalization capabilities across various dimensions, including language instructions, novel objects, unseen positions, changes in object appearance, background variations, and environmental shifts, often matching or exceeding the performance of OpenVLA.

However, the learned hash codes are embedded with limited discriminative semantics due to the intrinsic limitation of image representation. To address the problem, in this paper, we propose a novel hashing approach, dubbed as discrete semantic transfer hashing (DSTH). The key idea is to directly augment the semantics of discrete image hash codes by exploring auxiliary contextual modalities. To this end, a unified hashing framework is formulated to simultaneously preserve visual similarities of images and perform semantic transfer from contextual modalities. Furthermore, to guarantee direct semantic transfer and avoid information loss, we explicitly impose the discrete constraint, bit-uncorrelation constraint, and bit-balance constraint on hash codes. A novel and effective discrete optimization method based on augmented Lagrangian multiplier is developed to iteratively solve the optimization problem. The whole learning process has linear computation complexity and desirable scalability. Experiments on three benchmark data sets demonstrate the superiority of DSTH compared with several state-of-the-art approaches.},

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the wide application of hashing for large-scale image retrieval, because of its high computation efficiency and low storage cost. Particularly, benefiting from current advances in deep learning, supervised deep hashing methods have greatly boosted the retrieval performance, under the strong supervision of large amounts of manually annotated semantic labels. However, their performance is highly dependent upon the supervised labels, which significantly limits the scalability. In contrast, unsupervised deep hashing without label dependence enjoys the advantages of well scalability. Nevertheless, due to the relaxed hash optimization, and more importantly, the lack of semantic guidance, existing methods suffer from limited retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a SCAlable Deep Hashing (SCADH) to learn enhanced hash codes for social image retrieval. We formulate a unified scalable deep hash learning framework which explores the weak but free supervision of discriminative user tags that are commonly accompanied with social images. It jointly learns image representations and hash functions with deep neural networks, and simultaneously enhances the discriminative capability of image hash codes with the refined semantics from the accompanied social tags. Further, instead of simple relaxed hash optimization, we propose a discrete hash optimization method based on Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier to directly solve the hash codes and avoid the binary quantization information loss. Experiments on two standard social image datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared with state-of-the-art shallow and deep hashing techniques.},

In this article, we propose a simple but effective Unsupervised Deep K-means Hashing (UDKH) method to simultaneously alleviate the problems of image retrieval and clustering within a single learning framework. UDKH progressively improves the quality of cluster labels and binary hash codes by minimizing pair-wise supervision loss and optimizing the binary K-means to generate discriminative hash codes under the supervision of the learned cluster labels for effective image retrieval. Since the learned hash codes are discriminative, UDKH also improves the image clustering accuracy. Experiments on test datasets demonstrate its effectiveness for image retrieval and clustering.},

	abstract = {Social network stores and disseminates a tremendous amount of user shared images. Deep hashing is an efficient indexing technique to support large-scale social image retrieval, due to its deep representation capability, fast retrieval speed and low storage cost. Particularly, unsupervised deep hashing has well scalability as it does not require any manually labelled data for training. However, owing to the lacking of label guidance, existing methods suffer from severe semantic shortage when optimizing a large amount of deep neural network parameters. Differently, in this paper, we propose a Dual-level Semantic Transfer Deep Hashing (DSTDH) method to alleviate this problem with a unified deep hash learning framework. Our model targets at learning the semantically enhanced deep hash codes by specially exploiting the user-generated tags associated with the social images. Specifically, we design a complementary dual-level semantic transfer mechanism to efficiently discover the potential semantics of tags and seamlessly transfer them into binary hash codes. On the one hand, instance-level semantics are directly preserved into hash codes from the associated tags with adverse noise removing. Besides, an image-concept hypergraph is constructed for indirectly transferring the latent high-order semantic correlations of images and tags into hash codes. Moreover, the hash codes are obtained simultaneously with the deep representation learning by the discrete hash optimization strategy. Extensive experiments on two public social image retrieval datasets validate the superior performance of our method compared with state-of-the-art hashing methods.

However, in practice, source samples are not always available due to privacy protection and storage resource limitations. To address this concern, Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) has recently attracted growing research attention, as it only needs a pre-trained source model without direct access to source data. In this paper, we propose a novel Adversarial SOurce GEneration (ASOGE) method for SFDA, which introduces an additional generative module to produce synthetic labeled source samples and uses them to facilitate cross-domain adaptation. Unlike early studies that train the generator independently and perform the adaptation only after the generator is finished, ASOGE integrates the generation and adaptation stages within a collaborative framework by making them play an adversarial game. In the generation stage, the labeled source samples are not produced blindly; instead, they are hard-to-align samples that provide knowledge more worth learning for the adaptation stage. To achieve a fine-grained domain alignment, a class-aware discrepancy between source and target domains is measured via contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ASOGE compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {In modern healthcare, the demand for autonomous robotic assistants has grown significantly, particularly in the operating room, where surgical tasks require precision and reliability. Robotic scrub nurses have emerged as a promising solution to improve efficiency and reduce human error during surgery. However, challenges remain in terms of accurately grasping and handing over surgical instruments, especially when dealing with complex or difficult objects in dynamic environments. In this work, we introduce a novel robotic scrub nurse system, RoboNurse-VLA, built on a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model by integrating the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) and the Llama 2 language model. The proposed RoboNurse-VLA system enables highly precise grasping and handover of surgical instruments in real-time based on voice commands from the surgeon. Leveraging state-of-the-art vision and language models, the system can address key challenges for object detection, pose optimization, and the handling of complex and difficult-to-grasp instruments. Through extensive evaluations, RoboNurse-VLA demonstrates superior performance compared to existing models, achieving high success rates in surgical instrument handovers, even with unseen tools and challenging items. This work presents a significant step forward in autonomous surgical assistance, showcasing the potential of integrating VLA models for real-world medical applications.

Central to our approach is a next-token prediction objective, enabling the model to reason effectively over the user's query in the context of current observations. Subsequently, a diffusion model is attached to generate robust action outputs. To enhance policy learning through self-reasoning, we introduce a novel reasoning injection module that integrates reasoning phrases directly into the policy learning process. The whole framework is simple and flexible, making it easy to deploy and upgrade. We conduct extensive experiments using multiple real robots to validate the effectiveness of DiffusionVLA. Our tests include a challenging factory sorting task, where DiffusionVLA successfully categorizes objects, including those not seen during training. We observe that the reasoning module makes the model interpretable. It allows observers to understand the model thought process and identify potential causes of policy failures. Additionally, we test DiffusionVLA on a zero-shot bin-picking task, achieving 63.7{\textbackslash}\% accuracy on 102 previously unseen objects. Our method demonstrates robustness to visual changes, such as distractors and new backgrounds, and easily adapts to new embodiments. Furthermore, DiffusionVLA can follow novel instructions and retain conversational ability. Notably, DiffusionVLA is data-efficient and fast at inference; our smallest DiffusionVLA-2B runs 82Hz on a single A6000 GPU and can train from scratch on less than 50 demonstrations for a complex task. Finally, we scale the model from 2B to 72B parameters, showcasing improved generalization capabilities with increased model size.},

	abstract = {Adversarial attacks, particularly targeted transfer-based attacks, can be used to assess the adversarial robustness of large visual-language models (VLMs), allowing for a more thorough examination of potential security flaws before deployment. However, previous transfer-based adversarial attacks incur high costs due to high iteration counts and complex method structure. Furthermore, due to the unnaturalness of adversarial semantics, the generated adversarial examples have low transferability. These issues limit the utility of existing methods for assessing robustness. To address these issues, we propose AdvDiffVLM, which uses diffusion models to generate natural, unrestricted and targeted adversarial examples via score matching. Specifically, AdvDiffVLM uses Adaptive Ensemble Gradient Estimation (AEGE) to modify the score during the diffusion model’s reverse generation process, ensuring that the produced adversarial examples have natural adversarial targeted semantics, which improves their transferability. Simultaneously, to improve the quality of adversarial examples, we use the GradCAM-guided Mask Generation (GCMG) to disperse adversarial semantics throughout the image rather than concentrating them in a single area. Finally, AdvDiffVLM embeds more target semantics into adversarial examples after multiple iterations. Experimental results show that our method generates adversarial examples 5x to 10x faster than state-of-the-art (SOTA) transfer-based adversarial attacks while maintaining higher quality adversarial examples. Furthermore, compared to previous transfer-based adversarial attacks, the adversarial examples generated by our method have better transferability.

titleTranslation: 视觉-语言模型的目标化和可传递对抗样本的有效生成：扩散模型
abstractTranslation: 对抗性攻击，特别是针对转移的攻击，可以用来评估大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）的对抗稳健性，在部署之前可更彻底地检查潜在的安全漏洞。然而，以往的基于转移的对抗性攻击由于迭代次数多且方法结构复杂而造成成本高。此外，由于对抗性语义的不自然性，生成的对抗性示例的可转移性较低。这些问题限制了现有方法评估稳健性的效用。为解决这些问题，我们提出了AdvDiffVLM，该方法使用扩散模型通过评分匹配生成自然、无限制和有针对性的对抗性示例。具体而言，AdvDiffVLM使用自适应集成梯度估计（AEGE）来在扩散模型的反向生成过程中修改评分，确保生成的对抗性示例具有自然的对抗性有针对性的语义，从而提高其可转移性。同时，为了改善对抗性示例的质量，我们使用GradCAM引导掩膜生成（GCMG）将对抗性语义分散到图像中的各个区域，而不是集中在一个区域。最后，AdvDiffVLM在多次迭代后将更多目标语义嵌入对抗性示例中。实验结果显示，我们的方法生成的对抗性示例比最先进的基于转移的对抗攻击快5倍到10倍，同时保持更高质量的对抗性示例。此外，与以往的基于转移的对抗性攻击相比，我们方法生成的对抗性示例具有更好的可转移性。值得注意的是，AdvDiffVLM在黑盒环境中成功攻击了各种商用VLMs，包括GPT-4V。该代码可在https://github.com/gq-max/AdvDiffVLM找到。},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples resulting from adding small-magnitude perturbations to inputs. Such adversarial examples can mislead DNNs to produce adversary-selected results. Different attack strategies have been proposed to generate adversarial examples, but how to produce them with high perceptual quality and more efficiently requires more research efforts. In this paper, we propose AdvGAN to generate adversarial examples with generative adversarial networks (GANs), which can learn and approximate the distribution of original instances. For AdvGAN, once the generator is trained, it can generate adversarial perturbations efficiently for any instance, so as to potentially accelerate adversarial training as defenses. We apply AdvGAN in both semi-whitebox and black-box attack settings. In semi-whitebox attacks, there is no need to access the original target model after the generator is trained, in contrast to traditional white-box attacks. In black-box attacks, we dynamically train a distilled model for the black-box model and optimize the generator accordingly. Adversarial examples generated by AdvGAN on different target models have high attack success rate under state-of-the-art defenses compared to other attacks. Our attack has placed the first with 92.76\% accuracy on a public MNIST black-box attack challenge.},

We seek a straightforward way of making use of existing vision-language models (VLMs) with simple fine-tuning on robotics data.

Unlike prior works, RoboFlamingo utilizes pre-trained VLMs for single-step visionlanguage comprehension, models sequential history information with an explicit policy head, and is slightly fine-tuned by imitation learning only on languageconditioned manipulation datasets. Such a decomposition provides RoboFlamingo the flexibility for open-loop control and deployment on low-performance platforms. By exceeding the state-of-the-art performance with a large margin on the tested benchmark, we show that RoboFlamingo can be an effective and competitive alternative to adapt VLMs to robot control. Our extensive experimental results also reveal several interesting conclusions regarding the behavior of different pre-trained VLMs on manipulation tasks. RoboFlamingo can be trained or evaluated on a single GPU server, and we believe it has the potential to be a cost-effective and easy-to-use solution for robotics manipulation, empowering everyone with the ability to fine-tune their own robotics policy.

	abstract = {Embodied tasks require the agent to fully understand 3D scenes simultaneously with its exploration, so an online, real-time, fine-grained and highly-generalized 3D perception model is desperately needed. Since high-quality 3D data is limited, directly training such a model in 3D is almost infeasible. Meanwhile, vision foundation models (VFM) has revolutionized the field of 2D computer vision with superior performance, which makes the use of VFM to assist embodied 3D perception a promising direction. However, most existing VFM-assisted 3D perception methods are either offline or too slow that cannot be applied in practical embodied tasks. In this paper, we aim to leverage Segment Anything Model (SAM) for real-time 3D instance segmentation in an online setting. This is a challenging problem since future frames are not available in the input streaming RGB-D video, and an instance may be observed in several frames so object matching between frames is required. To address these challenges, we first propose a geometric-aware query lifting module to represent the 2D masks generated by SAM by 3D-aware queries, which is then iteratively refined by a dual-level query decoder. In this way, the 2D masks are transferred to fine-grained shapes on 3D point clouds. Benefit from the query representation for 3D masks, we can compute the similarity matrix between the 3D masks from different views by efficient matrix operation, which enables real-time inference. Experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, SceneNN and 3RScan show our method achieves leading performance even compared with offline methods. Our method also demonstrates great generalization ability in several zero-shot dataset transferring experiments and show great potential in open-vocabulary and data-efficient setting. Code and demo are available at https://xuxw98.github.io/ESAM/, with only one RTX 3090 GPU required for training and evaluation.},

This paper presents an Agent-Constitution-based agent framework, TrustAgent, with a particular focus on improving the LLM-based agent safety. The proposed framework ensures strict adherence to the Agent Constitution through three strategic components: pre-planning strategy which injects safety knowledge to the model before plan generation, in-planning strategy which enhances safety during plan generation, and post-planning strategy which ensures safety by post-planning inspection. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively enhance an LLM agent’s safety across multiple domains by identifying and mitigating potential dangers during the planning. Further analysis reveals that the framework not only improves safety but also enhances the helpfulness of the agent. Additionally, we highlight the importance of the LLM reasoning ability in adhering to the Constitution.

To study this issue, we present SafeAgentBench—a new benchmark for safety-aware task planning of embodied LLM agents. SafeAgentBench includes: (1) a new dataset with 750 tasks, covering 10 potential hazards and 3 task types; (2) SafeAgentEnv, a universal embodied environment with a low-level controller, supporting multi-agent execution with 17 high-level actions for 8 state-of-the-art baselines; and (3) reliable evaluation methods from both execution and semantic perspectives. Experimental results show that the best-performing baseline gets 69\% success rate and only 5\% rejection rate for hazardous tasks, indicating significant safety risks.

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are shown to possess a wealth of actionable knowledge that can be extracted for robot manipulation in the form of reasoning and planning. Despite the progress, most still rely on pre-defined motion primitives to carry out the physical interactions with the environment, which remains a major bottleneck. In this work, we aim to synthesize robot trajectories, i.e., a dense sequence of 6-DoF end-effector waypoints, for a large variety of manipulation tasks given an open-set of instructions and an open-set of objects. We achieve this by first observing that LLMs excel at inferring affordances and constraints given a free-form language instruction. More importantly, by leveraging their code-writing capabilities, they can interact with a vision-language model (VLM) to compose 3D value maps to ground the knowledge into the observation space of the agent. The composed value maps are then used in a model-based planning framework to zero-shot synthesize closed-loop robot trajectories with robustness to dynamic perturbations. We further demonstrate how the proposed framework can benefit from online experiences by efficiently learning a dynamics model for scenes that involve contact-rich interactions. We present a large-scale study of the proposed method in both simulated and real-robot environments, showcasing the ability to perform a large variety of everyday manipulation tasks specified in free-form natural language.

Representative artificial neural networks in these fields span convolutional neural networks, Transformers, and deep Q-networks. Built upon unimodal neural networks, numerous multi-modal models have been introduced to address a range of tasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, and speech recognition. The rise of instruction-following robotic policies in embodied AI has spurred the development of a novel category of multi-modal models known as vision-language-action models (VLAs). Their multi-modality capability has become a foundational element in robot learning. Various methods have been proposed to enhance traits such as versatility, dexterity, and generalizability. Some models focus on refining specific components. Others aim to develop control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. Certain VLAs serve as high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into executable subtasks. Over the past few years, a myriad of VLAs have emerged, reflecting the rapid advancement of embodied AI. Therefore, it is imperative to capture the evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey.},

Recent large language models (LLM) can embed rich semantic knowledge for agents in plan generation of complex tasks, while they lack the information about the realistic world and usually yield infeasible action sequences. In this paper, we propose a TAsk Planing Agent (TaPA) in embodied tasks for grounded planning with physical scene constraint, where the agent generates executable plans according to the existed objects in the scene by aligning LLMs with the visual perception models. Specifically, we first construct a multimodal dataset containing triplets of indoor scenes, instructions and action plans, where we provide the designed prompts and the list of existing objects in the scene for GPT-3.5 to generate a large number of instructions and corresponding planned actions. The generated data is leveraged for grounded plan tuning of pre-trained LLMs. During inference, we discover the objects in the scene by extending open-vocabulary object detectors to multi-view RGB images collected in different achievable locations. Experimental results show that the generated plan from our TaPA framework can achieve higher success rate than LLaVA and GPT-3.5 by a sizable margin, which indicates the practicality of embodied task planning in general and complex environments.},

However, it remains unclear whether they have the capacity to generate grounded, executable plans for embodied tasks. This is a challenging task as LMs lack the ability to perceive the environment through vision and feedback from the physical environment. In this paper, we address this important research question and present the first investigation into the topic. Our novel problem formulation, named G-PlanET, inputs a high-level goal and a data table about objects in a specific environment, and then outputs a step-by-step actionable plan for a robotic agent to follow. To facilitate the study, we establish an evaluation protocol and design a dedicated metric, KAS, to assess the quality of the plans. Our experiments demonstrate that the use of tables for encoding the environment and an iterative decoding strategy can significantly enhance the LMs' ability in grounded planning.

By using multi-source simulators as the backend simulator, it can provide immediate environment feedback to LLMs, which enables LLMs to interact dynamically with the environment and re-plan as necessary. We evaluated the state-of-the-art open source and closed source foundation models, including GPT-4, LLAMA and Mistral on our proposed benchmark. While they perform adequately well on simple navigation tasks, their performance can significantly deteriorate when faced with tasks that require a deeper understanding of spatial, temporal, and causal relationships. Thus, our benchmark distinguishes itself as a large-scale, quantifiable, highly automated, and fine-grained diagnostic framework that presents a significant challenge to the latest foundation models.

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient method for Human-Gaze-Target (HGT) detection, i.e., gaze following. Current approaches decouple the HGT detection task into separate branches of salient object detection and human gaze prediction, employing a two-stage framework where human head locations must first be detected and then be fed into the next gaze target prediction sub-network. In contrast, we redefine the HGT detection task as detecting human head locations and their gaze targets, simultaneously. By this way, our method, named Human-Gaze-Target detection TRansformer or HGTTR, streamlines the HGT detection pipeline by eliminating all other additional components. HGTTR reasons about the relations of salient objects and human gaze from the global image context. Moreover, unlike existing two-stage methods that require human head locations as input and can predict only one human's gaze target at a time, HGTTR can directly predict the locations of all people and their gaze targets at one time in an end-to-end manner. The effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method are verified with extensive experiments on the two standard benchmark datasets, GazeFollowing and VideoAttentionTarget. Without bells and whistles, HGTTR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by large margins (6.4 mAP gain on GazeFollowing and 10.3 mAP gain on VideoAttentionTarget) with a much simpler architecture.},

abstractTranslation: 在本文中，我们提出了一种有效的人类凝视目标 （HGT） 检测方法，即凝视跟随。目前的方法将 HGT 检测任务解耦为显著目标检测和人类凝视预测的不同分支，采用两阶段框架，其中必须首先检测人类头部位置，然后馈送到下一个凝视目标预测子网络。相比之下，我们将 HGT 检测任务重新定义为同时检测人类头部位置及其凝视目标。通过这种方式，我们名为 Human-Gaze-Target detection TRansformer 或 HGTTR 的方法通过消除所有其他附加组件来简化 HGT 检测管道。HGTTR 从全局图像背景中推理突出物体与人类凝视的关系。此外，与现有的需要人类头部位置作为输入且一次只能预测一个人的注视目标的两阶段方法不同，HGTTR 可以端到端地直接预测所有人及其注视目标的位置。我们提出的方法的有效性和稳健性通过在两个标准基准数据集 GazeFollowing 和 VideoAttentionTarget 上进行大量实验得到了验证。没有花里胡哨的东西，HGTTR 的性能大大优于现有的最先进的方法（GazeFollowing 增益 6.4 mAP，VideoAttentionTarget 增益 10.3 mAP），架构要简单得多。

	abstract = {We aim at advancing open-vocabulary object detection, which detects objects described by arbitrary text inputs. The fundamental challenge is the availability of training data. It is costly to further scale up the number of classes contained in existing object detection datasets. To overcome this challenge, we propose ViLD, a training method via Vision and Language knowledge Distillation. Our method distills the knowledge from a pretrained open-vocabulary image classification model (teacher) into a two-stage detector (student). Specifically, we use the teacher model to encode category texts and image regions of object proposals. Then we train a student detector, whose region embeddings of detected boxes are aligned with the text and image embeddings inferred by the teacher. We benchmark on LVIS by holding out all rare categories as novel categories that are not seen during training. ViLD obtains 16.1 mask AP\$\_r\$ with a ResNet-50 backbone, even outperforming the supervised counterpart by 3.8. When trained with a stronger teacher model ALIGN, ViLD achieves 26.3 AP\$\_r\$. The model can directly transfer to other datasets without finetuning, achieving 72.2 AP\$\_\{50\}\$ on PASCAL VOC, 36.6 AP on COCO and 11.8 AP on Objects365. On COCO, ViLD outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by 4.8 on novel AP and 11.4 on overall AP.

Results from analyzing fixation points from different sensors and observing velocity profiles over the course of pointing provide insights into optimally configuring features for predicting the target angles. Following this analysis, we train a recurrent neural network that feeds on sliding window inputs for continuously operating target direction prediction from start to finish. The input window contains historical data from past to current frames, capturing temporal changes in the feature data. By feeding on this input, our model can predict the direction of the target at any given time during pointing. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating eye-tracker data into the prediction model boosts the maximum achievable accuracy by 2.5 times when compared to baselines without eye-tracker data inputs.

	abstract = {For robots to follow instructions from people, they must be able to connect the rich semantic information in human vocabulary, e.g. "can you get me the pink stuffed whale?" to their sensory observations and actions. This brings up a notably difficult challenge for robots: while robot learning approaches allow robots to learn many different behaviors from first-hand experience, it is impractical for robots to have first-hand experiences that span all of this semantic information. We would like a robot's policy to be able to perceive and pick up the pink stuffed whale, even if it has never seen any data interacting with a stuffed whale before. Fortunately, static data on the internet has vast semantic information, and this information is captured in pre-trained vision-language models. In this paper, we study whether we can interface robot policies with these pre-trained models, with the aim of allowing robots to complete instructions involving object categories that the robot has never seen first-hand. We develop a simple approach, which we call Manipulation of Open-World Objects (MOO), which leverages a pre-trained vision-language model to extract object-identifying information from the language command and image, and conditions the robot policy on the current image, the instruction, and the extracted object information. In a variety of experiments on a real mobile manipulator, we find that MOO generalizes zero-shot to a wide range of novel object categories and environments. In addition, we show how MOO generalizes to other, non-language-based input modalities to specify the object of interest such as finger pointing, and how it can be further extended to enable open-world navigation and manipulation.

Despite the attempts to further incorporate global search, prevailing mechanisms that cooperate local and global search are relatively static, thus are still sub-optimal for improving tracking performance. By further studying the local and global search results, we raise a question: can we allow more dynamics for cooperating both results? In this paper, we propose to introduce more dynamics by devising a dynamic attention-guided multi-trajectory tracking strategy. In particular, we construct dynamic appearance model that contains multiple target templates, each of which provides its own attention for locating the target in the new frame. Guided by different attention, we maintain diversified tracking results for the target to build multi-trajectory tracking history, allowing more candidates to represent the true target trajectory. After spanning the whole sequence, we introduce a multi-trajectory selection network to find the best trajectory that deliver improved tracking performance. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed tracking strategy achieves compelling performance on various large-scale tracking benchmarks.

titleTranslation: 用于单个目标跟踪的动态注意力引导多轨迹分析

This information not only improves the accuracy of deep learning models for X-ray analysis but also their interpretability, enhancing transparency in decision-making. However, the current eye-tracking data is dispersed, unprocessed, and ambiguous, making it difficult to derive meaningful insights. Therefore, there is a need to create a new dataset with more focus and purposeful eyetracking data, improving its utility for diagnostic applications. In this work, we propose a refinement method inspired by the target-present visual search challenge: there is a specific finding and fixations are guided to locate it. After refining the existing eye-tracking datasets, we transform them into a curated visual search dataset, called GazeSearch, specifically for radiology findings, where each fixation sequence is purposefully aligned to the task of locating a particular finding. Subsequently, we introduce a scan path prediction baseline, called ChestSearch, specifically tailored to GazeSearch.

	abstract = {Estimating eye-gaze from images alone is a challenging task, in large parts due to un-observable person-specific factors. Achieving high accuracy typically requires labeled data from test users which may not be attainable in real applications. We observe that there exists a strong relationship between what users are looking at and the appearance of the user's eyes. In response to this understanding, we propose a novel dataset and accompanying method which aims to explicitly learn these semantic and temporal relationships. Our video dataset consists of time-synchronized screen recordings, user-facing camera views, and eye gaze data, which allows for new benchmarks in temporal gaze tracking as well as label-free refinement of gaze. Importantly, we demonstrate that the fusion of information from visual stimuli as well as eye images can lead towards achieving performance similar to literature-reported figures acquired through supervised personalization. Our final method yields significant performance improvements on our proposed EVE dataset, with up to a 28 percent improvement in Point-of-Gaze estimates (resulting in 2.49 degrees in angular error), paving the path towards high-accuracy screen-based eye tracking purely from webcam sensors.

The emergence of foundation models as the "brain" of EAI agents for high-level task planning has shown promising results. However, the deployment of these agents in physical environments presents significant safety challenges. For instance, a housekeeping robot lacking sufficient risk awareness might place a metal container in a microwave, potentially causing a fire. To address these critical safety concerns, comprehensive pre-deployment risk assessments are imperative. This study introduces EARBench, a novel framework for automated physical risk assessment in EAI scenarios. EAIRiskBench employs a multi-agent cooperative system that leverages various foundation models to generate safety guidelines, create risk-prone scenarios, make task planning, and evaluate safety systematically. Utilizing this framework, we construct EARDataset, comprising diverse test cases across various domains, encompassing both textual and visual scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art foundation models reveals alarming results: all models exhibit high task risk rates (TRR), with an average of 95.75\% across all evaluated models. To address these challenges, we further propose two prompting-based risk mitigation strategies. While these strategies demonstrate some efficacy in reducing TRR, the improvements are limited, still indicating substantial safety concerns. This study provides the first large-scale assessment of physical risk awareness in EAI agents. Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced safety measures in EAI systems and provide valuable insights for future research directions in developing safer embodied artificial intelligence system.

Specifically, three vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve this type of attack: (i) manipulation of LLMs within robotic systems, (ii) misalignment between linguistic outputs and physical actions, and (iii) unintentional hazardous behaviors caused by world knowledge's flaws. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark of various malicious physical action queries to evaluate BadRobot's attack performance. Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments against existing prominent embodied LLM frameworks (e.g., Voxposer, Code as Policies, and ProgPrompt) demonstrate the effectiveness of our BadRobot. Warning: This paper contains harmful AI-generated language and aggressive actions.},

	abstract = {The integration of large language models (LLMs) into the planning module of Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) systems has greatly enhanced their ability to translate complex user instructions into executable policies. In this paper, we demystified how traditional LLM jailbreak attacks behave in the Embodied AI context. We conducted a comprehensive safety analysis of the LLM-based planning module of embodied AI systems against jailbreak attacks. Using the carefully crafted Harmful-RLbench, we accessed 20 open-source and proprietary LLMs under traditional jailbreak attacks, and highlighted two key challenges when adopting the prior jailbreak techniques to embodied AI contexts: (1) The harmful text output by LLMs does not necessarily induce harmful policies in Embodied AI context, and (2) even we can generate harmful policies, we have to guarantee they are executable in practice. To overcome those challenges, we propose Policy Executable (POEX) jailbreak attacks, where harmful instructions and optimized suffixes are injected into LLM-based planning modules, leading embodied AI to perform harmful actions in both simulated and physical environments. Our approach involves constraining adversarial suffixes to evade detection and fine-tuning a policy evaluater to improve the executability of harmful policies. We conducted extensive experiments on both a robotic arm embodied AI platform and simulators, to validate the attack and policy success rates on 136 harmful instructions from Harmful-RLbench. Our findings expose serious safety vulnerabilities in LLM-based planning modules, including the ability of POEX to be transferred across models. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies, such as safety-constrained prompts, pre- and post-planning checks, to address these vulnerabilities and ensure the safe deployment of embodied AI in real-world settings.},

	abstract = {The deployment of embodied navigation agents in safety-critical environments raises concerns about their vulnerability to adversarial attacks on deep neural networks. However, current attack methods often lack practicality due to challenges in transitioning from the digital to the physical world, while existing physical attacks for object detection fail to achieve both multi-view effectiveness and naturalness. To address this, we propose a practical attack method for embodied navigation by attaching adversarial patches with learnable textures and opacity to objects. Specifically, to ensure effectiveness across varying viewpoints, we employ a multi-view optimization strategy based on object-aware sampling, which uses feedback from the navigation model to optimize the patch's texture. To make the patch inconspicuous to human observers, we introduce a two-stage opacity optimization mechanism, where opacity is refined after texture optimization. Experimental results show our adversarial patches reduce navigation success rates by about 40\%, outperforming previous methods in practicality, effectiveness, and naturalness.

To address this issue, efforts have been investigated to study physical patch attacks in the physical world, especially for object detection models.

In this paper, we study legitimate adversarial attacks that evade both human eyes and detection models in the physical world. To this end, we delve into the issue of patch rationality, and propose some indicators for evaluating the rationality of physical adversarial patches. Besides, we propose a novel framework with a two-stage training strategy to generate our legitimate adversarial patches (LAPs).

It's trained end-to-end across text, vision, and audio, meaning all inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network. GPT-4o can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds, which is similar to human response time in conversation. It matches GPT-4 Turbo performance on text in English and code, with significant improvement on text in non-English languages, while also being much faster and 50{\textbackslash}\% cheaper in the API. GPT-4o is especially better at vision and audio understanding compared to existing models. In line with our commitment to building AI safely and consistent with our voluntary commitments to the White House, we are sharing the GPT-4o System Card, which includes our Preparedness Framework evaluations. In this System Card, we provide a detailed look at GPT-4o's capabilities, limitations, and safety evaluations across multiple categories, focusing on speech-to-speech while also evaluating text and image capabilities, and measures we've implemented to ensure the model is safe and aligned. We also include third-party assessments on dangerous capabilities, as well as discussion of potential societal impacts of GPT-4o's text and vision capabilities.},

Existing work on adversarial attacks have mainly focused on static scenes; however, it remains unclear whether such attacks are effective against embodied agents, which could navigate and interact with a dynamic environment. In this work, we take the first step to study adversarial attacks for embodied agents. In particular, we generate spatiotemporal perturbations to form 3D adversarial examples, which exploit the interaction history in both the temporal and spatial dimensions. Regarding the temporal dimension, since agents make predictions based on historical observations, we develop a trajectory attention module to explore scene view contributions, which further help localize 3D objects appeared with the highest stimuli. By conciliating with clues from the temporal dimension, along the spatial dimension, we adversarially perturb the physical properties (e.g., texture and 3D shape) of the contextual objects that appeared in the most important scene views. Extensive experiments on the EQA-v1 dataset for several embodied tasks in both the white-box and black-box settings have been conducted, which demonstrate that our perturbations have strong attack and generalization abilities.},

	abstract = {Large policies pretrained on diverse robot datasets have the potential to transform robotic learning: instead of training new policies from scratch, such generalist robot policies may be finetuned with only a little in-domain data, yet generalize broadly. However, to be widely applicable across a range of robotic learning scenarios, environments, and tasks, such policies need to handle diverse sensors and action spaces, accommodate a variety of commonly used robotic platforms, and finetune readily and efficiently to new domains. In this work, we aim to lay the groundwork for developing open-source, widely applicable, generalist policies for robotic manipulation. As a first step, we introduce Octo, a large transformer-based policy trained on 800k trajectories from the Open X-Embodiment dataset, the largest robot manipulation dataset to date. It can be instructed via language commands or goal images and can be effectively finetuned to robot setups with new sensory inputs and action spaces within a few hours on standard consumer GPUs. In experiments across 9 robotic platforms, we demonstrate that Octo serves as a versatile policy initialization that can be effectively finetuned to new observation and action spaces. We also perform detailed ablations of design decisions for the Octo model, from architecture to training data, to guide future research on building generalist robot models.},

TLDR: 这项工作介绍了 Octo，这是一种基于 transformer 的大型策略，在 Open X-Embodiment 数据集（迄今为止最大的机器人操作数据集）的 800k 轨迹上进行了训练，并展示了 Octo 作为一种多功能策略初始化，可以有效地微调到新的观察和动作空间。
titleTranslation: Octo：开源通才机器人策略
abstractTranslation: 在不同机器人数据集上预先训练的大型策略有可能改变机器人学习：这种通用的机器人策略可能只使用少量的域内数据进行微调，但可以广泛推广，而不是从头开始训练新策略。然而，为了广泛适用于一系列机器人学习场景、环境和任务，此类策略需要处理不同的传感器和动作空间，适应各种常用的机器人平台，并随时有效地针对新领域进行微调。在这项工作中，我们的目标是为开发开源、广泛适用的机器人操作通用策略奠定基础。作为第一步，我们引入了 Octo，这是一个基于 transformer 的大型策略，在 Open X-Embodiment 数据集的 800k 轨迹上进行了训练，这是迄今为止最大的机器人操作数据集。它可以通过语言命令或目标图像进行指示，并且可以在标准消费类 GPU 上通过新的感官输入和动作空间在几个小时内有效地微调为机器人设置。在 9 个机器人平台上的实验中，我们证明了 Octo 是一种多功能的策略初始化，可以有效地微调到新的观察和操作空间。我们还对 Octo 模型的设计决策进行详细的分析，从架构到训练数据，以指导未来构建通才机器人模型的研究。},

	abstract = {Recently, transformers have become incredibly popular in computer vision and vision-language tasks. This notable rise in their usage can be primarily attributed to the capabilities offered by attention mechanisms and the outstanding ability of transformers to adapt and apply themselves to a variety of tasks and domains. Their versatility and state-of-the-art performance have established them as indispensable tools for a wide array of applications. However, in the constantly changing landscape of machine learning, the assurance of the trustworthiness of transformers holds utmost importance. This paper conducts a thorough examination of vision-language transformers, employing three fundamental principles of responsible AI: Bias, Robustness, and Interpretability. The primary objective of this paper is to delve into the intricacies and complexities associated with the practical use of transformers, with the overarching goal of advancing our comprehension of how to enhance their reliability and accountability.},

UPD examines the VLM's ability to withhold answers when faced with unsolvable problems in the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. UPD encompasses three distinct settings: Absent Answer Detection (AAD), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (IASD), and Incompatible Visual Question Detection (IVQD). To deeply investigate the UPD problem, extensive experiments indicate that most VLMs, including GPT-4V and LLaVA-Next-34B, struggle with our benchmarks to varying extents, highlighting significant room for the improvements. To address UPD, we explore both training-free and training-based solutions, offering new insights into their effectiveness and limitations. We hope our insights, together with future efforts within the proposed UPD settings, will enhance the broader understanding and development of more practical and reliable VLMs.},

	abstract = {Embodied agents operating in complex and uncertain environments face considerable challenges. While some advanced agents handle complex manipulation tasks with proficiency, their success often hinges on extensive training data to develop their capabilities. In contrast, humans typically rely on recalling past experiences and analogous situations to solve new problems. Aiming to emulate this human approach in robotics, we introduce the RetrievalAugmented Embodied Agent (RAEA). This innovative system equips robots with a form of shared memory, significantly enhancing their performance. Our approach integrates a policy retriever, allowing robots to access relevant strategies from an external policy memory bank based on multi-modal inputs. Additionally, a policy generator is employed to assimilate these strategies into the learning process, enabling robots to formulate effective responses to tasks. Extensive testing of RAEA in both simulated and real-world scenarios demonstrates its superior performance over traditional methods, representing a major leap forward in robotic technology.},

	abstract = {Modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems are powered by foundation models. This paper presents a new set of foundation models, called Llama 3. It is a herd of language models that natively support multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is a dense Transformer with 405B parameters and a context window of up to 128K tokens. This paper presents an extensive empirical evaluation of Llama 3. We find that Llama 3 delivers comparable quality to leading language models such as GPT-4 on a plethora of tasks. We publicly release Llama 3, including pre-trained and post-trained versions of the 405B parameter language model and our Llama Guard 3 model for input and output safety. The paper also presents the results of experiments in which we integrate image, video, and speech capabilities into Llama 3 via a compositional approach. We observe this approach performs competitively with the state-of-the-art on image, video, and speech recognition tasks. The resulting models are not yet being broadly released as they are still under development.},

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5\% and 17.0\%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},

	abstract = {Large, high-capacity models trained on diverse datasets have shown remarkable successes on efficiently tackling downstream applications. In domains from NLP to Computer Vision, this has led to a consolidation of pretrained models, with general pretrained backbones serving as a starting point for many applications. Can such a consolidation happen in robotics? Conventionally, robotic learning methods train a separate model for every application, every robot, and even every environment. Can we instead train generalist X-robot policy that can be adapted efficiently to new robots, tasks, and environments? In this paper, we provide datasets in standardized data formats and models to make it possible to explore this possibility in the context of robotic manipulation, alongside experimental results that provide an example of effective X-robot policies. We assemble a dataset from 22 different robots collected through a collaboration between 21 institutions, demonstrating 527 skills (160266 tasks). We show that a high-capacity model trained on this data, which we call RT-X, exhibits positive transfer and improves the capabilities of multiple robots by leveraging experience from other platforms.

	abstract = {State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a ﬁxed set of predetermined object categories. This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efﬁcient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of ﬁne-grained object classiﬁcation. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset speciﬁc training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on. We release our code and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/OpenAI/CLIP.},

Yet learning to ground language is challenging, typically requiring domain-specific engineering or large quantities of human interaction data. To address this challenge, we propose using pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to supervise embodied agents. We combine ideas from model distillation and hindsight experience replay (HER), using a VLM to retroactively generate language describing the agent’s behavior. Simple prompting allows us to control the supervision signal, teaching an agent to interact with novel objects based on their names (e.g., planes) or their features (e.g., colors) in a 3D rendered environment. Fewshot prompting lets us teach abstract category membership, including pre-existing categories (food vs toys) and ad-hoc ones (arbitrary preferences over objects). Our work outlines a new and effective way to use internet-scale VLMs, repurposing the generic language grounding acquired by such models to teach task-relevant groundings to embodied agents.},

	abstract = {Large language models excel at a wide range of complex tasks. However, enabling general inference in the real world, e.g. for robotics problems, raises the challenge of grounding. We propose embodied language models to directly incorporate real-world continuous sensor modalities into language models and thereby establish the link between words and percepts. Input to our embodied language model are multimodal sentences that interleave visual, continuous state estimation, and textual input encodings. We train these encodings end-to-end, in conjunction with a pre-trained large language model, for multiple embodied tasks including sequential robotic manipulation planning, visual question answering, and captioning. Our evaluations show that PaLM-E, a single large embodied multimodal model, can address a variety of embodied reasoning tasks, from a variety of observation modalities, on multiple embodiments, and further, exhibits positive transfer: the model benefits from diverse joint training across internet-scale language, vision, and visual-language domains. Our largest model with 562B parameters, in addition to being trained on robotics tasks, is a visual-language generalist with state-of-the-art performance on OK-VQA, and retains generalist language capabilities with increasing scale.},

	abstract = {Today’s robot policies exhibit subpar performance when faced with the challenge of generalizing to novel environments. Human corrective feedback is a crucial form of guidance to enable such generalization. However, adapting to and learning from online human corrections is a non-trivial endeavor: not only do robots need to remember human feedback over time to retrieve the right information in new settings and reduce the intervention rate, but also they would need to be able to respond to feedback that can be arbitrary corrections about high-level human preferences to low-level adjustments to skill parameters. In this work, we present Distillation and Retrieval of Online Corrections (DROC), a large language model (LLM)based system that can respond to arbitrary forms of language feedback, distill generalizable knowledge from corrections, and retrieve relevant past experiences based on textual and visual similarity for improving performance in novel settings. DROC is able to respond to a sequence of online language corrections that address failures in both high-level task plans and low-level skill primitives. We demonstrate that DROC effectively distills the relevant information from the sequence of online corrections in a knowledge base and retrieves that knowledge in settings with new task or object instances. DROC outperforms other techniques that directly generate robot code via LLMs [1] by using only half of the total number of corrections needed in the first round and requires little to no corrections after two iterations.

Experiments on three large language models show that chain of thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks.

While most agents are language-based, relying on closed-source API with text-rich meta-information (e.g., HTML or accessibility tree), they show limitations in perceiving UI visuals as humans do, highlighting the need for GUI visual agents. In this work, we develop a visionlanguage-action model in digital world, namely ShowUI, which features the following innovations: (i) UI-Guided Visual Token Selection to reduce computational costs by formulating screenshots as an UI connected graph, adaptively identifying their redundant relationship and serve as the criteria for token selection during self-attention blocks; (ii) Interleaved Vision-Language-Action Streaming that flexibly unifies diverse needs within GUI tasks, enabling effective management of visual-action history in navigation or pairing multi-turn query-action sequences per screenshot to enhance training efficiency; (iii) Small-scale Highquality GUI Instruction-following Datasets by careful data curation and employing a resampling strategy to address significant data type imbalances. With above components, ShowUI, a lightweight 2B model using 256K data, achieves a strong 75.1\% accuracy in zero-shot screenshot grounding. Its UI-guided token selection further reduces 33\% of redundant visual tokens during training and speeds up the performance by 1.4×. Navigation experiments across web [12], mobile [36], and online [40] environments further underscore the effectiveness and potential of our model in advancing GUI visual agents.

Existing text-to-image models struggle to follow detailed image descriptions and often ignore words or confuse the meaning of prompts.

We address this by training a bespoke image captioner and use it to recaption the training dataset. We then train several text-to-image models and find that training on these synthetic captions reliably improves prompt following ability. Finally, we use these findings to build DALL-E 3: a new text-to-image generation system, and benchmark its performance on an evaluation designed to measure prompt following, coherence, and aesthetics, finding that it compares favorably to competitors.

Moreover, many aspects of animal intelligence are deeply embodied in these evolved morphologies. However, the principles governing relations between environmental complexity, evolved morphology, and the learnability of intelligent control, remain elusive, because performing large-scale in silico experiments on evolution and learning is challenging. Here, we introduce Deep Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL): a computational framework which can evolve diverse agent morphologies to learn challenging locomotion and manipulation tasks in complex environments. Leveraging DERL we demonstrate several relations between environmental complexity, morphological intelligence and the learnability of control. First, environmental complexity fosters the evolution of morphological intelligence as quantified by the ability of a morphology to facilitate the learning of novel tasks. Second, we demonstrate a morphological Baldwin effect i.e., in our simulations evolution rapidly selects morphologies that learn faster, thereby enabling behaviors learned late in the lifetime of early ancestors to be expressed early in the descendants lifetime. Third, we suggest a mechanistic basis for the above relationships through the evolution of morphologies that are more physically stable and energy efficient, and can therefore facilitate learning and control.},

	url = {https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/jia21b.html},
	abstract = {Pre-trained representations are becoming crucial for many NLP and perception tasks. While representation learning in NLP has transitioned to training on raw text without human annotations, visual and vision-language representations still rely heavily on curated training datasets that are expensive or require expert knowledge. For vision applications, representations are mostly learned using datasets with explicit class labels such as ImageNet or OpenImages. For vision-language, popular datasets like Conceptual Captions, MSCOCO, or CLIP all involve a non-trivial data collection (and cleaning) process. This costly curation process limits the size of datasets and hence hinders the scaling of trained models. In this paper, we leverage a noisy dataset of over one billion image alt-text pairs, obtained without expensive filtering or post-processing steps in the Conceptual Captions dataset. A simple dual-encoder architecture learns to align visual and language representations of the image and text pairs using a contrastive loss. We show that the scale of our corpus can make up for its noise and leads to state-of-the-art representations even with such a simple learning scheme. Our visual representation achieves strong performance when transferred to classification tasks such as ImageNet and VTAB. The aligned visual and language representations enables zero-shot image classification and also set new state-of-the-art results on Flickr30K and MSCOCO image-text retrieval benchmarks, even when compared with more sophisticated cross-attention models. The representations also enable cross-modality search with complex text and text + image queries.},

	abstract = {Abstract Together with `On Computable Numbers', `Computing Machinery and Intelligence' forms Turing's best-known work. This elegant and sometimes amusing essay was originally published in 1950 in the leading philosophy journal Mind. Turing's friend Robin Gandy (like Turing a mathematical logician) said that `Computing Machinery and Intelligence'… was intended not so much as a penetrating contribution to philosophy but as propaganda. Turing thought the time had come for philosophers and mathematicians and scientists to take seriously the fact that computers were not merely calculating engines but were capable of behaviour which must be accounted as intelligent; he sought to persuade people that this was so. He wrote this paper—unlike his mathematical papers—quickly and with enjoyment. I can remember him reading aloud to me some of the passages— always with a smile, sometimes with a giggle. The quality and originality of `Computing Machinery and Intelligence' have earned it a place among the classics of philosophy of mind. `Computing Machinery and Intelligence' contains Turing's principal exposition of the famous `imitation game' or Turing test. The test first appeared, in a restricted form, in the closing paragraphs of `Intelligent Machinery' (Chapter 10). Chapters 13 and 14, dating from 1951 and 1952 respectively, contain further discussion and amplification; unpublished until 1999, this important additional material throws new light on how the Turing test is to be understood. The imitation game involves three participants: a computer, a human interrogator, and a human `foil'. The interrogator attempts to determine, by asking questions of the other two participants, which of them is the computer. All communication is via keyboard and screen, or an equivalent arrangement (Turing suggested a teleprinter link). The interrogator may ask questions as penetrating and wide-ranging as he or she likes, and the computer is permitted to do everything possible to force a wrong identification. (So the computer might answer `No' in response to `Are you a computer?' and might follow a request to multiply one large number by another with a long pause and a plausibly incorrect answer.) The foil must help the interrogator to make a correct identification.},

	abstract = {Large vision-language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4 have achieved unprecedented performance in response generation, especially with visual inputs, enabling more creative and adaptable interaction than large language models such as ChatGPT. Nonetheless, multimodal generation exacerbates safety concerns, since adversaries may successfully evade the entire system by subtly manipulating the most vulnerable modality (e.g., vision). To this end, we propose evaluating the robustness of open-source large VLMs in the most realistic and high-risk setting, where adversaries have only black-box system access and seek to deceive the model into returning the targeted responses. In particular, we first craft targeted adversarial examples against pretrained models such as CLIP and BLIP, and then transfer these adversarial examples to other VLMs such as MiniGPT-4, LLaVA, UniDiffuser, BLIP-2, and Img2Prompt. In addition, we observe that black-box queries on these VLMs can further improve the effectiveness of targeted evasion, resulting in a surprisingly high success rate for generating targeted responses. Our findings provide a quantitative understanding regarding the adversarial vulnerability of large VLMs and call for a more thorough examination of their potential security flaws before deployment in practice.

            Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have gained popularity across different engineering fields due to their effectiveness in solving realistic problems with noisy data and often partially missing physics. In PINNs, automatic differentiation is leveraged to evaluate differential operators without discretization errors, and a multitask learning problem is defined in order to simultaneously fit observed data while respecting the underlying governing laws of physics. Here, we present applications of PINNs to various prototype heat transfer problems, targeting in particular realistic conditions not readily tackled with traditional computational methods. To this end, we first consider forced and mixed convection with unknown thermal boundary conditions on the heated surfaces and aim to obtain the temperature and velocity fields everywhere in the domain, including the boundaries, given some sparse temperature measurements. We also consider the prototype Stefan problem for two-phase flow, aiming to infer the moving interface, the velocity and temperature fields everywhere as well as the different conductivities of a solid and a liquid phase, given a few temperature measurements inside the domain. Finally, we present some realistic industrial applications related to power electronics to highlight the practicality of PINNs as well as the effective use of neural networks in solving general heat transfer problems of industrial complexity. Taken together, the results presented herein demonstrate that PINNs not only can solve ill-posed problems, which are beyond the reach of traditional computational methods, but they can also bridge the gap between computational and experimental heat transfer.},

	abstract = {Machine learning methods provide new perspective for more convenient and efficient prediction of groundwater flow. In this study, a deep learning method “GW-PINN” without labeled data for solving groundwater flow equations with wells was proposed. GW-PINN takes the physics inform neural network (PINN) as the backbone and uses either the hard or soft constraint in the loss function for training. A locally refined sampling strategy (LRS) is adopted to generate the consistent spatial sampling points for problems with strong hydraulic head change, and then combined with an appropriate temporal sampling scheme to obtain the final spatial-temporal sampling points. A snowball-style two-stage training strategy by dividing the temporal domain into two subdomains is designed to decrease the sampling points. Five cases were designed to test the training performance of GW-PINN under different sampling strategies and two constraints. The predicted results of GW-PINN were compared with MODFLOW and the analytical solution. The results demonstrate that GW-PINN possesses strong ability in capturing the hydraulic head change for both confined and un-confined aquifers. The hard constraint owns more robust learning ability than the soft constraint. The LRS strategy can generate more accurate results with much fewer sampling points than traditional sampling strategies, and the snowball-style two-stage training strategy is significantly efficient for problems with the drastic change of hydraulic head. Furthermore, the application of GW-PINN as a surrogate model for parameterized groundwater flow equations is illustrated. This study provides an option tool for efficient groundwater flow simulation, especially for those with local refinements are needed.},

Concretely, we introduce 7 benchmark datasets, including 96 visual and 87 textual corruptions, to investigate the robustness of different adaptation methods, the impact of available adaptation examples, and the influence of trainable parameter size during adaptation. Our analysis reveals that: 1) Adaptation methods are more sensitive to text corruptions than visual corruptions. 2) Full fine-tuning does not consistently provide the highest robustness; instead, adapters can achieve better robustness with comparable clean performance. 3) Contrary to expectations, our findings indicate that increasing the number of adaptation data and parameters does not guarantee enhanced robustness; instead, it results in even lower robustness. We hope this study could benefit future research in developing robust multimodal adaptation methods.

	abstract = {Many problems in science and engineering can be modeled mathematically by a group of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Mechanism-based Scientiﬁc Computing following PDEs has long been an essential paradigm for studying topics such as Computational Fluid Dynamics, multiphysics simulation, molecular dynamics, or even dynamical systems. It is a vibrant multi-disciplinary ﬁeld of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential. At the same time, solving PDEs efﬁciently has been a long-standing challenge. Generally, apart from a few Differential Equations where analytical solutions are directly available, more equations must rely on numerical approaches to be solved approximately, e.g., the Finite Difference Method and Finite Element Method. These numerical methods usually divide a continuous problem domain into discrete grids and then concentrate on solving the system at each of those points or elements. Although these traditional numerical methods show effectiveness in solving PDEs, the vast number of iterative operations accompanying each step forward greatly reduces the efﬁciency. Recently, another equally important paradigm, data-based computation represented by Deep Learning, has emerged as an effective means of solving PDEs. Surprisingly, a comprehensive review of this interesting subdivision of AI for Science is still lacking. This survey aims to categorize and review the current progress on Deep Neural Networks for PDEs. We discuss the literature published in this subﬁeld over the past decades and present them in a common taxonomy, followed by an overview and classiﬁcation of applications of these related methods in scientiﬁc research and engineering/medical scenarios. The origin, developing history, character, and sort, as well as the future trends in each potential direction of this area are also introduced.},

	abstract = {Partial differential equations (PDEs) are a common means of describing physical processes. Solving PDEs can obtain simulated results of physical evolution. Currently, the mainstream neural network method is to minimize the loss of PDEs thus constraining neural networks to fit the solution mappings. By the implementation of differentiation, the methods can be divided into PINN methods based on automatic differentiation and other methods based on discrete differentiation. PINN methods rely on automatic backpropagation, and the computation step is time-consuming, for iterative training, the complexity of the neural network and the number of collocation points are limited to a small condition, thus abating accuracy. The discrete differentiation is more efficient in computation, following the regular computational domain assumption. However, in practice, the assumption does not necessarily hold. In this paper, we propose a PhyGNNet method to solve PDEs based on graph neural network and discrete differentiation on irregular domain. Meanwhile, to verify the validity of the method, we solve Burgers equation and conduct a numerical comparison with PINN. The results show that the proposed method performs better both in fit ability and time extrapolation than PINN. Code is available at https://github.com/echowve/phygnnet.},

	abstract = {The combination of Monte Carlo methods and deep learning has recently led to efficient algorithms for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in high dimensions. Related learning problems are often stated as variational formulations based on associated stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which allow the minimization of corresponding losses using gradient-based optimization methods. In respective numerical implementations it is therefore crucial to rely on adequate gradient estimators that exhibit low variance in order to reach convergence accurately and swiftly. In this article, we rigorously investigate corresponding numerical aspects that appear in the context of linear Kolmogorov PDEs. In particular, we systematically compare existing deep learning approaches and provide theoretical explanations for their performances. Subsequently, we suggest novel methods that can be shown to be more robust both theoretically and numerically, leading to substantial performance improvements.},

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) trained on code-completion have been shown to be capable of synthesizing simple Python programs from docstrings [1]. We find that these code-writing LLMs can be re-purposed to write robot policy code, given natural language commands. Specifically, policy code can express functions or feedback loops that process perception outputs (e.g., from object detectors [2], [3]) and parameterize control primitive APIs. When provided as input several example language commands (formatted as comments) followed by corresponding policy code (via few-shot prompting), LLMs can take in new commands and autonomously re-compose API calls to generate new policy code respectively. By chaining classic logic structures and referencing third-party libraries (e.g., NumPy, Shapely) to perform arithmetic, LLMs used in this way can write robot policies that (i) exhibit spatial-geometric reasoning, (ii) generalize to new instructions, and (iii) prescribe precise values (e.g., velocities) to ambiguous descriptions (‘faster’) depending on context (i.e., behavioral commonsense). This paper presents Code as Policies: a robot-centric formulation of language model generated programs (LMPs) that can represent reactive policies (e.g., impedance controllers), as well as waypoint-based policies (vision-based pick and place, trajectory-based control), demonstrated across multiple real robot platforms. Central to our approach is prompting hierarchical code-gen (recursively defining undefined functions), which can write more complex code and also improves state-of-the-art to solve 39.8\% of problems on the HumanEval [1] benchmark.

	abstract = {Recent advances of data-driven machine learning have revolutionized ﬁelds like computer vision, reinforcement learning, and many scientiﬁc and engineering domains. In many real-world and scientiﬁc problems, systems that generate data are governed by physical laws. Recent work shows that it provides potential beneﬁts for machine learning models by incorporating the physical prior and collected data, which makes the intersection of machine learning and physics become a prevailing paradigm. By integrating the data and mathematical physics models seamlessly, it can guide the machine learning model towards solutions that are physically plausible, improving accuracy and efﬁciency even in uncertain and high-dimensional contexts. In this survey, we present this learning paradigm called Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) which is to build a model that leverages empirical data and available physical prior knowledge to improve performance on a set of tasks that involve a physical mechanism. We systematically review the recent development of physics-informed machine learning from three perspectives of machine learning tasks, representation of physical prior, and methods for incorporating physical prior. We also propose several important open research problems based on the current trends in the ﬁeld. We argue that encoding different forms of physical prior into model architectures, optimizers, inference algorithms, and signiﬁcant domain-speciﬁc applications like inverse engineering design and robotic control is far from being fully explored in the ﬁeld of physics-informed machine learning. We believe that the interdisciplinary research of physics-informed machine learning will signiﬁcantly propel research progress, foster the creation of more effective machine learning models, and also offer invaluable assistance in addressing long-standing problems in related disciplines.},

	abstract = {Large-scale generative language and vision-language models (LLMs and VLMs) excel in few-shot in-context learning for decision making and instruction following. However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations to be included in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a task demonstration that may contain inefficiencies or mistakes, a VLM abstracts the trajectory into a generalized program of thoughts by correcting inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: causal relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task-relevant visual elements. These programs of thought are iteratively improved and adapted through human feedback while the agent attempts to execute the trajectory in a similar environment. The resulting examples, when used as exemplars in the prompt, significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Moreover, as the agent’s library of examples grows, it becomes more efficient, relying less on human feedback and requiring fewer environment interactions per demonstration. Our ICAL agent surpasses the state-of-the-art in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6\% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over the SOTA from 14.3\% to 22.7\% using GPT4V. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on manual prompt engineering and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such programs of thought.},

Traditional physics-based models are sample efﬁcient, and interpretable but often rely on rigid assumptions. Furthermore, direct numerical approximation is usually computationally intensive, requiring signiﬁcant computational resources and expertise, and many real-world systems do not have fully-known governing laws. While deep learning (DL) provides novel alternatives for efﬁciently recognizing complex patterns and emulating nonlinear dynamics, its predictions do not necessarily obey the governing laws of physical systems, nor do they generalize well across different systems. Thus, the study of physics-guided DL emerged and has gained great progress. Physics-guided DL aims to take the best from both physics-based modeling and state-of-the-art DL models to better solve scientiﬁc problems. In this paper, we provide a structured overview of existing methodologies of integrating prior physical knowledge or physics-based modeling into DL, with a special emphasis on learning dynamical systems.

In order to remove the skill barriers for laymen, recent motion generation methods can directly generate human motions conditioned on natural languages. However, it remains challenging to achieve diverse and fine-grained motion generation with various text inputs. To address this problem, we propose MotionDiffuse, the first diffusion model-based text-driven motion generation framework, which demonstrates several desired properties over existing methods. 1) Probabilistic Mapping. Instead of a deterministic language-motion mapping, MotionDiffuse generates motions through a series of denoising steps in which variations are injected. 2) Realistic Synthesis. MotionDiffuse excels at modeling complicated data distribution and generating vivid motion sequences. 3) Multi-Level Manipulation. MotionDiffuse responds to fine-grained instructions on body parts, and arbitrary-length motion synthesis with time-varied text prompts. Our experiments show MotionDiffuse outperforms existing SoTA methods by convincing margins on text-driven motion generation and action-conditioned motion generation. A qualitative analysis further demonstrates MotionDiffuse's controllability for comprehensive motion generation. Homepage: https://mingyuan-zhang.github.io/projects/MotionDiffuse.html},

By incorporating the physical information into the neural network through loss functions, it can predict solutions to PDEs in an unsupervised manner. However, the design of the neural network structure basically relies on prior knowledge and experience, which has caused great trouble and high computational overhead. Therefore, we propose a neural architecture search-guided method, namely NAS-PINN, to automatically search the optimum neural architecture for solving certain PDEs. By relaxing the search space into a continuous one and utilizing masks to realize the addition of tensors in different shapes, NAS-PINN can be trained through a bilevel optimization, where the inner loop optimizes the weights and bias of neural networks and the outer loop the architecture parameters. We verify the ability of NAS-PINN by several numerical experiments including Poisson, Burgers, and Advection equations. The characteristics of effective neural architectures for solving different PDEs are summarized, which can be used to guide the design of neural networks in PINN. It is found that more hidden layers do not necessarily mean better performance and sometimes can be harmful. Especially for Poisson and Advection, a shallow neural network with more neurons is more appropriate in PINNs. It is also indicated that for complex problems, neural networks with residual connection can improve the performance of PINNs.},

	abstract = {We put forth a deep learning approach for discovering nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations from scattered and potentially noisy observations in space and time. Speciﬁcally, we approximate the unknown solution as well as the nonlinear dynamics by two deep neural networks. The ﬁrst network acts as a prior on the unknown solution and essentially enables us to avoid numerical diﬀerentiations which are inherently ill-conditioned and unstable. The second network represents the nonlinear dynamics and helps us distill the mechanisms that govern the evolution of a given spatiotemporal data-set. We test the eﬀectiveness of our approach for several benchmark problems spanning a number of scientiﬁc domains and demonstrate how the proposed framework can help us accurately learn the underlying dynamics and forecast future states of the system. In particular, we study the Burgers’, Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, nonlinear Schr¨odinger, and Navier-Stokes equations.},

	abstract = {We present the largest and most comprehensive empirical study of pre-trained visual representations (PVRs) or visual ‘foundation models’ for Embodied AI. First, we curate CORTEXBENCH, consisting of 17 different tasks spanning locomotion, navigation, dexterous, and mobile manipulation. Next, we systematically evaluate existing PVRs and find that none are universally dominant. To study the effect of pre-training data size and diversity, we combine over 4,000 hours of egocentric videos from 7 different sources (over 4.3M images) and ImageNet to train differentsized vision transformers using Masked Auto-Encoding (MAE) on slices of this data. Contrary to inferences from prior work, we find that scaling dataset size and diversity does not improve performance universally (but does so on average). Our largest model, named VC-1, outperforms all prior PVRs on average but does not universally dominate either. Next, we show that task- or domain-specific adaptation of VC-1 leads to substantial gains, with VC-1 (adapted) achieving competitive or superior performance than the best known results on all of the benchmarks in CORTEXBENCH. Finally, we present real-world hardware experiments, in which VC-1 and VC-1 (adapted) outperform the strongest pre-existing PVR. Overall, this paper presents no new techniques but a rigorous systematic evaluation, a broad set of findings about PVRs (that in some cases, refute those made in narrow domains in prior work), and open-sourced code and models (that required over 10,000 GPU-hours to train) for the benefit of the research community.},

	url = {https://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/long18a.html},
	abstract = {Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a prominent role in many disciplines of science and engineering. PDEs are commonly derived based on empirical observations. However, with the rapid development of sensors, computational power, and data storage in the past decade, huge quantities of data can be easily collected and efficiently stored. Such vast quantity of data offers new opportunities for data-driven discovery of physical laws. Inspired by the latest development of neural network designs in deep learning, we propose a new feed-forward deep network, called PDE-Net, to fulfill two objectives at the same time: to accurately predict dynamics of complex systems and to uncover the underlying hidden PDE models. Comparing with existing approaches, our approach has the most flexibility by learning both differential operators and the nonlinear response function of the underlying PDE model. A special feature of the proposed PDE-Net is that all filters are properly constrained, which enables us to easily identify the governing PDE models while still maintaining the expressive and predictive power of the network. These constrains are carefully designed by fully exploiting the relation between the orders of differential operators and the orders of sum rules of filters (an important concept originated from wavelet theory). Numerical experiments show that the PDE-Net has the potential to uncover the hidden PDE of the observed dynamics, and predict the dynamical behavior for a relatively long time, even in a noisy environment.
  偏微分方程 （PDE） 在科学和工程的许多学科中都发挥着重要作用。偏微分方程通常是根据实证观察得出的。然而，随着过去十年传感器、计算能力和数据存储的快速发展，海量数据可以轻松收集和高效存储。如此大量的数据为数据驱动的物理定律发现提供了新的机会。受深度学习中神经网络设计最新发展的启发，我们提出了一种新的前馈深度网络，称为 PDE-Net，以同时实现两个目标：准确预测复杂系统的动力学并揭示潜在的隐藏 PDE 模型。与现有方法相比，我们的方法通过学习微分算子和底层偏微分方程模型的非线性响应函数，具有最大的灵活性。所提出的 PDE-Net 的一个特殊功能是所有滤波器都受到适当约束，这使我们能够轻松识别控制 PDE 模型，同时仍然保持网络的表达和预测能力。这些约束是通过充分利用微分算子的阶数和滤波器的和规则的阶数之间的关系（一个源自小波理论的重要概念）来精心设计的。数值实验表明，PDE-Net 有可能揭示观察到的动力学的隐藏 PDE，并在相对较长的时间内预测动力学行为，即使在嘈杂的环境中也是如此。},

	abstract = {Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in diverse applications; however, its use in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) has emerged only recently. Here, we present an overview of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which embed a PDE into the loss of the neural network using automatic differentiation. The PINN algorithm is simple, and it can be applied to different types of PDEs, including integro-differential equations, fractional PDEs, and stochastic PDEs. Moreover, from an implementation point of view, PINNs solve inverse problems as easily as forward problems. We propose a new residualbased adaptive refinement (RAR) method to improve the training efficiency of PINNs. For pedagogical reasons, we compare the PINN algorithm to a standard finite element method. We also present a Python library for PINNs, DeepXDE, which is designed to serve both as an educational tool to be used in the classroom as well as a research tool for solving problems in computational science and engineering. Specifically, DeepXDE can solve forward problems given initial and boundary conditions, as well as inverse problems given some extra measurements. DeepXDE supports complex-geometry domains based on the technique of constructive solid geometry and enables the user code to be compact, resembling closely the mathematical formulation. We introduce the usage of DeepXDE and its customizability, and we also demonstrate the capability of PINNs and the userfriendliness of DeepXDE for five different examples. More broadly, DeepXDE contributes to the more rapid development of the emerging scientific machine learning field.},
